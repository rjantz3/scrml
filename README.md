# scrmlTS

The working compiler for **scrml** — a single-file, full-stack reactive web language.
This is the TypeScript/JavaScript implementation that compiles `.scrml` source into
HTML, CSS, client JS, and server route handlers in a single pass.

scrml lets you write a complete app in one file: markup, reactive state, scoped CSS,
SQL, server functions, and inline tests — no build config, no separate server file,
no state management library.

# scrml

**An app should be an exhaustive state machine.**

scrml is a compiled language built around one organizing principle: the structural
shape of a shipped UI is the structural shape of its state. Every reachable state
has UI. Every transition is intentional. Every effect runs at the right moment.
**Provability falls out of the language's natural shape — not from separate proof
ceremony.**

The compiler does the wiring: server/client splitting, reactivity, routing,
async scheduling, SQL batching, channel sync, validity-surface synthesis. You
declare the shape; the compiler emits plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No virtual
DOM, no JSX, no `node_modules`.

```bash
scrml compile hello.scrml -o dist/
```

## The Tier 0 / 1 / 2 ladder

Apps don't start at the north star; they evolve toward it. The Tier ladder lets
you start as a prototype and add structure as the design hardens — without
rewriting the markup tree. State-children carry forward verbatim between tiers;
the wrapper swap is the commitment moment.

| Tier  | Form                                       | What you get                                                           |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **0** | `if=` chains / `${ if (...) lift ... }`    | prototype; no exhaustiveness check                                     |
| **1** | `<match for=Type [on=expr]>`               | structural exhaustiveness check at compile time                        |
| **2** | `<engine for=Type initial=.Variant>`       | full deal — exhaustiveness + active transition rules (`rule=`) + per-state effect handlers (`<onTransition>`, `<onTimeout>`, `<onIdle>`) + composite hierarchy + `history` restore |

Adding a sixth variant later forces the compiler to remind you where every
transition into it should fire from. The state machine evolves; the compiler
enforces.

## Why scrml

**State is the declaration primitive.** `<count> = 0` declares a reactive cell;
`@count` reads or writes it. Compound state, derived (`const <total> = expr`),
server-pinned (`<users server>`), linear (exact-once) values, refinement-typed
cells — all sit on the same primitive with different attributes. The compiler
tracks the dependency graph and re-renders on change.

**Engines are the centerpiece.** When state goes from "a few booleans" to "this
app has phases," promote from booleans to a `<match>` block, then to `<engine>`.
The engine declares legal transitions per state via `rule=`, runs effect
handlers via `<onTransition>`, schedules timeouts via `<onTimeout>` (with
`cancelTimer("X")` builtin), watches for engine-wide idle via `<onIdle>`,
nests via composite state-children for sub-machines, and restores prior inner
state on re-entry via the `history` attribute. Five behaviorally-distinct UI
states authored once, exhaustively, with cross-state effects intentional and
co-located.

**Full-stack in one file.** Markup, logic, styles, SQL, server functions, error
handling, channels for realtime, inline tests — everything lives in `.scrml`.
The compiler analyzes your code and splits it across server and client
automatically. No API layer to maintain, no route files to keep in sync, no
API/UI drift.

**Errors are states, not booleans.** `try`/`catch` is not in scrml's vocabulary.
Failable functions surface errors as enum variants (`fn fetchItems()! -> LoadError`);
the `!{}` handler at the call site routes each variant into the right Phase
state. Missing-handler is a compile-time error; the failure modes live in the
type, not in `<isError>` + `<errorMsg>` boolean rubble.

**Validators auto-synthesize a validity surface.** Compound state with `req`
or `length` or other predicates produces `@form.isValid`, `@form.errors`,
`@form.touched`, `@form.submitted` rollups AND per-field `@form.name.isValid`,
`@form.name.errors` cells — all reactive, read-only. `<errors of=@form/>`
renders the active errors at the right time. Same word fires three places:
state validator (reactive), refinement type (compile-time + boundary), schema
column (DB-enforced). No bilingual schema; no Zod; no separate validation
library.

**The compiler eliminates N+1 automatically.** Because scrml owns both the
query context and the loop context, a `for (let x of xs) { ?{...where id =
${x.id}}.get() }` pattern is rewritten to one pre-loop `WHERE id IN (...)`
fetch plus a keyed `Map` lookup — no DataLoader, no manual batching.
Independent reads in a `!` handler share one `BEGIN DEFERRED`..`COMMIT`
envelope for snapshot consistency. [Measured Tier 2 wins](benchmarks/sql-batching/RESULTS.md):
~2× at N=10, ~3× at N=100, ~4× at N=1000 on on-disk WAL `bun:sqlite`.

**Realtime and workers as language primitives.** A `<channel>` block declares
a WebSocket endpoint — the compiler emits the upgrade route, client connection
manager, auto-reconnect, and pub/sub topic routing. State declared inside the
channel auto-syncs across every connected client. A nested `<program>` is a
Web Worker (or WASM module, or sidecar process) with typed RPC and supervised
restarts. No `new WebSocket()`, no `postMessage` plumbing, no worker-loader
config.

**No npm.** scrml ships its own stdlib: `auth`, `crypto`, `data`, `format`,
`fs`, `http`, `path`, `process`, `router`, `store`, `test`, `time`, `redis`,
`cron`, `regex`, `oauth`. Sixteen modules cover the surface a typical app
reaches for. No package manager, no dependency trees, no `node_modules`.

## Quick Example — a Counter (Tier 0)

```scrml
<program>

<count> = 0
<step>  = 1

<div class="counter">
    <span class="value">${@count}</>

    <select bind:value=@step>
        <option value="1">1</>
        <option value="5">5</>
        <option value="10">10</>
    </select>

    <button onclick=decrement() disabled=atMinimum()>-</>
    <button onclick=${reset(@count)}>Reset</>
    <button onclick=increment()>+</>
</div>

${
    function increment() { @count = @count + @step }
    function decrement() {
        if (@count - @step >= 0) { @count = @count - @step }
    }
    fn atMinimum() { return @count - @step < 0 }
}

#{
    .counter { text-align: center; font-family: system-ui; }
    .value   { font-size: 4rem; font-weight: 700; }
}

</>
```

State is declared with `<name> = init` (V5-strict). Access is `@name`. `<count>`
and `<step>` are plain reactive cells. `bind:value=@step` keeps the select and
the cell in sync. `fn atMinimum` is a pure predicate — the compiler verifies it
has no side effects (no SQL, no DOM mutation, no reactive writes, no `fetch`,
no `<request>` boundary). `reset(@count)` returns the cell to its declared
initial value. The compiler generates direct DOM manipulation; no virtual DOM,
no signals library.

This is **Tier 0** — booleans-as-lifecycle, no exhaustiveness check. Fine for
prototyping. The compiler nudges via lints (`W-LIFECYCLE-CANDIDATE`,
`W-MATCH-TRANSITIONS-ACCRUING`) when the shape suggests promotion.

## Engine Example — a Loader as a State Machine (Tier 2)

The same loader pattern that almost every UI needs — expressed as an exhaustive
state machine instead of boolean flags:

```scrml
<program db="items.db">

type LoadError:enum = {
    Network(msg: string)
    Empty
}

type Phase:enum = {
    Idle
    Loading
    Error(msg: string)
    Empty
    Success(count: int)
}

server function fetchItems()! -> LoadError {
    const result = ?{select * from items}
    if (result.length == 0) fail LoadError::Empty
    return result
}

function load() {
    @phase = .Loading
    const result = fetchItems() !{
        | ::Network msg -> { @phase = .Error(msg); return }
        | ::Empty       -> { @phase = .Empty;       return }
    }
    @phase = .Success(result.length)
}

<engine for=Phase initial=.Idle>

    <Idle rule=.Loading>
        <button onclick=load()>Load</button>
    </>

    <Loading rule=(.Success | .Error | .Empty)>
        Loading…
    </>

    <Error msg rule=.Loading>
        <div class="err">${msg}</div>
        <button onclick=${@phase = .Loading}>Retry</button>
    </>

    <Empty>
        No rows yet.
    </>

    <Success count>
        Got it: ${count} rows
    </>

    <onTransition from=.Loading to=.Success>
        ${ analytics.track("load.success") }
    </>

</>

</>
```

Five behaviorally-distinct UI states — Idle / Loading / Error / Empty / Success —
declared as variants of one enum. **Every variant has a UI block; the compiler
enforces this exhaustively.** Cross-state effects live next to the engine they
describe.

- **`rule=`** declares legal transitions FROM each state. `<Idle rule=.Loading>`
  means: from `Idle`, the only legal transition is to `Loading`. A typo like
  `@phase = .Loaded` is a compile-time error (variant doesn't exist). Writing
  `@phase = .Success(0)` from `Idle`'s body fires `E-ENGINE-INVALID-TRANSITION`
  — Idle's `rule=` doesn't include `.Success`. Use `rule=*` as the explicit
  wildcard escape hatch.
- **`<onTransition from= to=>`** runs effects on specific transitions —
  analytics, cleanup, side effects — co-located with the engine they describe,
  not scattered across `useEffect` hooks.
- **Errors are states, not booleans.** Instead of `<isError>` + `<errorMsg>`
  cells, the failure mode is a variant of `Phase`. The `!{}` handler at the
  call site routes each error variant into the right Phase variant. Missing
  handler arm: compile-time error.
- **Adding a sixth variant** later forces the compiler to remind you where
  every transition into it should fire from. State machine evolves; compiler
  enforces.

For the surface beyond the basic shape — composite state-children with nested
engines (sub-machines), the `history` attribute that restores prior inner state
on re-entry, `<onTimeout after=2s to=.Variant>` for per-state timeouts (with
named timers and `cancelTimer("name")` builtin), `<onIdle>` for engine-wide
event-timeout watchdogs, `internal:rule=` for transitions that don't exit /
re-enter the composite — see SPEC.md §51 and example
[`examples/14-mario-state-machine.scrml`](examples/14-mario-state-machine.scrml).

## Full-Stack in One File

A contact book with a database, server functions, and an auto-validated reactive
form — no API layer, no ORM, no route files, no separate validation schema:

```scrml
<program db="contacts.db">

<schema>
    contacts {
        name:  text req length(>=2)
        email: text req email
    }
</>

<entry>
    <name  req length(>=2)> = <input placeholder="Name"/>
    <email req email>       = <input type="email" placeholder="Email"/>
</>

<form onsubmit=addContact()>
    <entry.name/>
    <entry.email/>
    <errors of=@entry/>
    <button type="submit" disabled=${not @entry.isValid}>Add Contact</>
</form>

<ul>
    ${
        for (let c of ?{select name, email from contacts}.all()) {
            lift <li>${c.name} — ${c.email}</>
        }
    }
</ul>

${
    server function addContact() {
        ?{insert into contacts (name, email) values (${@entry.name}, ${@entry.email})}.run()
        reset(@entry)
    }
}

</>
```

Five things the compiler does that you don't write:

- **`<schema>` is the source of truth for the data shape.** The `contacts` block
  doubles as the database migration AND the source-level shared vocabulary.
  `req length(>=2)` lowers to `NOT NULL` + `CHECK (length(name) >= 2)` at the
  DB layer. The same `req length(>=2)` on the `<name>` cell above fires at the
  state-validator layer. Same word, same semantics, two enforcement loci. Add
  a third (refinement type on the function parameter) and it composes.
- **`<entry>` is compound state with bindable markup (Shape 2).** Each field
  declares a reactive cell *with* its render-spec. `<entry.name/>` in markup
  expands to the bound input element with `bind:value` wired automatically.
  Validators (`req`, `length(>=2)`, `email`) fire on input.
- **`@entry.isValid`** is auto-synthesized — a compound rollup over every
  field's validity. **`@entry.name.isValid`** is per-field. **`@entry.errors`**
  is a list of enum-tagged errors (`.Required`, `.LengthFailed(predicate)`),
  not strings — consumers pattern-match on the tag.
- **`<errors of=@entry/>`** renders the active errors at the right time
  (touched + submitted lifecycle managed automatically).
- **`addContact()` runs server-side** because it does SQL. The compiler infers
  the boundary, generates the route, the fetch call, CSRF tokens, parameterized
  queries, and serialization. `reset(@entry)` returns every field to its
  declared initial value. You never write any of this.

## Features

### State and Reactivity

- **Reactive state (`@var`)** — prefix any variable with `@` to make it reactive. Changes re-render dependent elements automatically. No wrappers, no hooks, no signals library.
- **Derived values (`~var`)** — tilde-prefixed variables recompute when their dependencies change. The compiler tracks the dependency graph.
- **Two-way binding (`bind:value`)** — keep form inputs and reactive variables in sync without boilerplate.
- **Absence value (`not`)** — a unified null/undefined replacement. `@result = not` means "no value yet." Check presence with `is some`, absence with `is not`. The compiler catches `== not` misuse at compile time (use `is not` instead).
- **Server/client state** — `server @var` pins state server-side so it never reaches the browser. `protect` hides fields from the client on struct types. Both are enforced at compile time.

### Linear Types

- **Exact-once consumption (`lin`)** — values that must be used exactly once. The compiler verifies this statically across all code paths, including branches and loops.
- **Site-agnostic** — a `lin` value can be created at one site, passed through function calls, and consumed at a completely different site. No manual threading through intermediate stages. If you need the value more than once, assign it to a `const` at the consumption site.
- See [`docs/lin.md`](./docs/lin.md) for a complete how-to guide: when to reach for `lin`, what counts as consumption, branch and loop rules, cross-`${}`-block usage, closures, and a fix-by-error-code catalog.

### Type Safety

- **`asIs` (not `any`)** — scrml has no `any` type. There is no "turn off the type checker" escape hatch. `asIs` accepts any type but forces you to resolve it to a concrete type before use or return — analogous to TypeScript's `unknown`, not `any`. Component bare props follow `asIs` rules: the compiler infers the concrete type from how you use the prop.

### Runtime Type Validation (replaces Zod)

scrml has built-in runtime type validation. The type annotation IS the validation schema — no separate schema library, no `z.object()` wrappers, no `z.infer<typeof>` indirection.

```scrml
@price: number(>0 && <10000) = userInput
@email: string(email) = formValue
@password: string(.length > 7 && .length < 255) = rawInput

type Invoice:struct = {
    amount: number(>0 && <10000)
    recipient: string(email)
}

fn process(amount: number(>0 && <10000)) {
    // amount is proven valid here — zero runtime checks inside the function
    let discounted = amount * 0.9
    let safe: number(>0 && <10000) = discounted  // boundary check emitted
}
```

The compiler uses a **three-zone enforcement model** (derived from SPARK/Ada):

| Zone | When | Cost |
|------|------|------|
| **Static** | Compiler can prove the value satisfies the constraint (e.g. literals) | Zero — no runtime code emitted |
| **Boundary** | Value comes from an unproven source (user input, API response, arithmetic) | One boolean check at assignment site |
| **Trusted** | Value was already checked in the current scope | Zero — compiler remembers the proof |

Boundary checks emit a single synchronous predicate test; on failure the compiler throws `E-CONTRACT-001-RT` labeled with the assignment site. Named shapes available today: `email`, `url`, `uuid`, `phone`, `date`, `time`, `color`. Composable predicates (`number(>0 && <10000)`, `string(.length > 7)`) cover the same ground as Zod schemas — with zero dependencies, zero bundle cost in proven code paths, and no separate schema language to keep in sync with your types.

### Free HTML Validation

The same predicate powers browser-native form validation. On `bind:value` inputs, the compiler derives the matching HTML attributes — `string(email)` emits `type="email"`, `number(>0 && <100)` emits `min="0" max="100"`, `string(uuid)` emits `pattern=...`, `string(.length > 7 && .length < 255)` emits `minlength="8" maxlength="254"`. One predicate, three enforcement points: server-side boundary check, client-side boundary check, browser-native pre-submit validation. You never write the HTML attrs by hand, and they never drift from the type.

### Variable Renaming

The compiler renames JavaScript bindings in the compiled output using a deterministic, type-derived encoding. `@shoppingCart` of type `Cart` becomes `_s7km3f2x00` — underscore prefix, kind character (`s` = struct, `p` = primitive, `e` = enum, and so on), an 8-character base36 FNV-1a hash of the canonical type string, and a per-scope sequence char. Two bindings of the same type share the hash; the sequence char disambiguates.

Because the name carries the type, runtime `reflect()` can recover the full type descriptor from a variable alone — without shipping any unused type metadata. The decode table is tree-shaken entirely when no `^{}` meta blocks reference runtime state, so most apps ship zero reflection bytes. Debug builds append `$originalName` so stack traces and DevTools stay readable; production builds reject that flag as a hard error.

This isn't bundler-style single-letter renaming — the names are longer than `a`, `b`, `c`. The wins are different: collision-free across scopes, type-introspectable at runtime, and protected fields can never leak into a client-side encoded name (the client schema view excludes them by construction, verified again at emit).

### Server/Client

- **Auto-split** — the compiler analyzes your code and decides what runs where. Protected fields and `server` functions force server-side execution.
- **SQL passthrough (`?{}`)** — query SQLite directly inside logic blocks. The compiler generates parameterized queries and handles serialization.
- **Automatic N+1 elimination (Tier 2).** A `for` loop whose body does `?{...WHERE id = ${x.id}}.get()` is rewritten to one pre-loop `WHERE id IN (?,?,?,...)` fetch plus a keyed `Map` lookup. No DataLoader, no manual batching. Measured ~2×/3×/4× at N=10/100/1000 on on-disk WAL `bun:sqlite` — see [benchmarks/sql-batching/RESULTS.md](benchmarks/sql-batching/RESULTS.md).
- **Implicit transaction envelopes (Tier 1).** Independent reads in a `!` handler share one `BEGIN DEFERRED`..`COMMIT` for snapshot consistency under concurrent writers. Explicit `transaction { }` blocks are left alone; a `W-BATCH-001` warning fires if the two would conflict.
- **Mount-hydration coalescing.** Multiple on-mount `server @var` loads on the same page are folded into a single `__mountHydrate` round-trip (§8.11) instead of one request per variable.
- **Opt-out per call site.** `?{...}.nobatch()` disables rewriting when you need an exact query shape — useful for `EXPLAIN`, stored-procedure calls, or measured hot paths.
- **Diagnostics, not silent magic.** `D-BATCH-001` flags near-miss loops that *almost* batch but don't (mutation in body, non-`.get()` chain, etc.), with the exact disqualifier. `E-BATCH-001` rejects `.nobatch()` composition with batched siblings; `E-BATCH-002` guards against the 32 766 `SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER` ceiling at runtime.
- **No API boilerplate** — server functions are called like local functions. The compiler generates routes, fetch calls, CSRF tokens, and serialization.

### Realtime and Workers

- **WebSocket channels (`<channel>`)** — a lifecycle element that declares a WebSocket endpoint. The compiler emits the Bun upgrade route, a client-side connection manager with exponential-backoff reconnect, and pub/sub topic routing. `onserver:open`, `onserver:message`, `onserver:close` run server-side; `onclient:open`, `onclient:close`, `onclient:error` run in the browser. `protect=` gates the upgrade with a session cookie check. No WebSocket or Bun-specific API appears in your source.
- **Shared reactive state (`@shared`)** — variables marked `@shared` inside a `<channel>` synchronize across every connected client automatically. Writing to `@shared count` in one browser tab updates it in every other tab subscribed to the same topic. The sync wire format is generated; you just write assignments.
- **`broadcast()` and `disconnect()`** — available inside any server handler declared in a channel's lexical scope. `broadcast(data)` fans out to every client on the active topic; `disconnect()` closes the connection. Dynamic topics via `topic=@room` — when `@room` changes, the channel re-subscribes; when `@room` is `not`, the connection stays open but subscribes to nothing.
- **Nested `<program>` = Web Worker.** Put a `<program name="compute">` inside your main program and the compiler spawns a Web Worker. Shared-nothing by construction — no accidental scope leaks. Call worker exports as typed RPC: `const result = await <#compute>.add(1, 2)`. The compiler enforces that cross-program calls are awaited.
- **Message passing with `when`.** `<#worker>.send(data)` posts to the worker; inside, `when message(data) { ... }` handles it and `send(data)` replies. The parent observes lifecycle with `when message from <#worker> (data)`, `when error from <#worker> (e)`, and `when terminate from <#worker>`. No manual `addEventListener('message', ...)` scaffolding.
- **Supervised restarts.** Declare `restart="on-error"`, `max-restarts=3`, `within=60` as attributes on the nested `<program>` and the compiler synthesizes crash detection and restart bookkeeping. `autostart="false"` defers launch until `<#name>.start()`.
- **WASM modules and foreign sidecars.** The same `<program>` syntax spawns a WASM module (`lang="rust" mode="wasm"`) or a subprocess sidecar (`lang="python"`) with HTTP/socket routing — one execution-context primitive covers workers, WASM, and language FFI.

### Components and Patterns

- **Components with props and slots** — `const Card = <div>` defines a component. Props are attributes; slots are named placeholders.
- **Enums and pattern matching** — Rust-style enums with exhaustive `match`. The compiler enforces that every variant is handled.
- **State machines** — declare `< machine>` with transition rules. The compiler prevents illegal state transitions.

### Metaprogramming

- **Compile-time meta (`^{}`)** — code that runs at compile time. Use `reflect()` to inspect types, `emit()` to generate markup, `compiler.*` to register macros. Meta blocks execute during compilation and produce source that's spliced into the AST.
- **Runtime meta** — meta blocks that reference `@var` reactive state run at runtime instead of compile time. The compiler classifies each block automatically based on what it references.

### Pure Functions

- **`fn` — compiler-enforced purity.** `fn` is not shorthand for `function` — it declares a pure function. The compiler statically verifies five prohibitions: no SQL access, no DOM mutation, no reactive writes, no `fetch`/network calls, no `<request>` boundaries. Use `function` for general-purpose callables; use `fn` for deterministic computations, state factories, predicates, and transformations.

### Styles

- **Scoped CSS (`#{}`)** — styles live next to the markup they apply to. The compiler handles scoping via native `@scope`.
- **Built-in Tailwind engine** — the compiler embeds a Tailwind utility registry. Use utility classes directly in markup; the compiler scans your HTML, resolves classes from the embedded registry, and emits only the CSS rules actually used. No Tailwind CLI, no PostCSS, no purge step.

### Error Handling and Testing

- **Error handling (`!{}`)** — typed error contexts with pattern-matched arms. Error propagation is inferred automatically.
- **Inline tests (`~{}`)** — write tests next to the code they verify. Stripped from production builds.

### Tooling

- **No npm — stdlib first** — scrml ships its own standard library. No package manager, no dependency trees, no node_modules.
- **`<program>` root** — configure database connections, protection rules, HTML spec version, and program-wide settings from a single root element.

## Language Contexts

scrml uses sigil-delimited contexts to separate concerns within a single file:

| Context | Sigil | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Program | `<program>` | App root — database, protection, config |
| Markup  | `<tag>` | HTML elements and components |
| State   | `< name>` | Server-persisted state blocks (note the space) |
| Logic   | `${}` | JavaScript expressions and functions |
| SQL     | `?{}` | Database queries (Bun.SQL tagged-template; SQLite shipping, Postgres in progress); auto-batched N+1 + envelope |
| CSS     | `#{}` | Scoped styles |
| Error   | `!{}` | Typed error handling |
| Meta    | `^{}` | Compile-time (or runtime) code generation |
| Test    | `~{}` | Inline tests (stripped from production) |
| Foreign | `_{}` | Inline foreign code *(specced, not yet implemented)* |

## Specced but Not Yet Implemented

These features are fully designed in the [language spec](compiler/SPEC.md) but not yet available in the compiler. They are listed here so you know what's coming and don't try to use them yet.

| Feature | Spec Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Foreign code contexts (`_{}`)**  | S23 | Embed non-JS code inline with level-marked braces (`_{}`/`_={...}=`). Enables inline Rust, Python, SQL extensions, or any language with a registered compiler. The foreign block is opaque to scrml — it passes through to an external toolchain. |
| **WASM call-char sigils** | S23.3 | Single-character sigils (`r{}`, `c{}`, `z{}`) for invoking compiled WASM functions from Rust, C, Zig, etc. Paired with `extern` declarations for type-safe FFI. |
| **Sidecar process declarations** | S23.4 | `use foreign:name { fn }` for declaring server-side sidecar processes (HTTP/socket services) that scrml routes to automatically. |
| **`RemoteData` enum** | S13.5 | Built-in `Loading / Loaded(T) / Failed(Error)` enum for modeling async fetch state. Pattern-matchable with exhaustive checking. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Compile a file

```bash
scrml compile hello.scrml -o dist/
```

This produces `dist/hello.html`, `dist/hello.client.js`, and `dist/hello.css`. Open the HTML file in a browser.

### Development with hot reload

```bash
scrml dev
```

`dev` starts a dev server with hot reload. Write `.scrml` files and see results immediately.

### Build for production

```bash
scrml build
```

The compiler produces optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No runtime framework ships to the browser.

The CLI (save, switch, merge, undo, history, status, land, init, describe, sync) wraps jj (jujutsu) as the engine until the scrml compiler can do AST-level conflict resolution natively. Long-term vision is a hosted forge; GitHub is the stopgap.

An "Interactive Development Experience" written entirely in scrml, with a focus-centered viewport, NeoVim-superset keybindings plus mouse, CodeMirror 6 + canvas overlay, and offline-first PWA delivery. Currently in design phase, awaiting compiler API exposure in scrmlTS. The companion [Z-motion input spec](https://github.com/bryanmaclee/6NZ/tree/main/z-motion-spec) is released under CC0 so others can adopt it.

## Status

scrml is open source under the [MIT License](./LICENSE). The language is still pre-1.0 — the spec evolves as we find friction and the compiler catches up. See [`docs/changelog.md`](./docs/changelog.md) for what just landed and what's in flight.

The compiler runs on [Bun](https://bun.sh). Compiled output is plain JavaScript that runs in any browser or JavaScript runtime.
