# scrml examples

Stop wiring. Start building.

These are runnable scrml apps — one file each. No build config, no separate server file, no
route definitions, no state management library. Just `.scrml`.

Each example is chosen to show something that takes real work in React or Vue but falls out
naturally from how scrml is designed.

## Quick start

```bash
# Compile any example
bun compiler/src/cli.js compile examples/01-hello.scrml -o dist/

# Output: dist/01-hello.html, dist/01-hello.client.js, dist/01-hello.css
# Open dist/01-hello.html in a browser.
```

## Sigil cheatsheet

| Sigil | Context | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `<var> = init` / `@var` | anywhere | Reactive state — `<var> = init` declares (V5-strict); `@var` reads/writes |
| `${}` | markup | Logic block — JS expressions, control flow, declarations |
| `?{}` | logic | SQL passthrough — direct database access |
| `#{}` | markup | Scoped CSS — styles for this file only |
| `^{}` | logic | Meta block — compile-time code generation |
| `~{}` | logic | Inline test — stripped from production builds |
| `!{}` | logic | Error handler — exhaustive error matching |

---

| File | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| `01-hello.scrml` | Bare markup and the three closer forms — the syntax in ten lines |
| `02-counter.scrml` | Reactive state with `<count> = 0` (V5-strict decl), `@count` access, `bind:value`, bare-call `onclick=fn()` |
| `03-contact-book.scrml` | Full-stack in one file: `protect=` state, `?{}` SQL, server-classified functions (auto-inferred via body content), form binding |
| `04-live-search.scrml` | Reactive filtering with `for`/`lift`/`if (continue)`, no derived-state boilerplate |
| `05-multi-step-form.scrml` | Wizard UI: enum steps, components, `if=`/`else-if=`/`else` chain on component instances |
| `06-kanban-board.scrml` | Enum-driven columns (bar-form `\|`), array `.map()` mutation, CSS grid |
| `07-admin-dashboard.scrml` | `^{}` meta block + `reflect(User)` — table headers generated from the type |
| `08-chat.scrml` | Single-user message log: optimistic update + DB persistence (NOT real-time — see 15) |
| `09-error-handling.scrml` | `!{}` exhaustive error matching, enum error types with `renders` clauses |
| `10-inline-tests.scrml` | `~{}` inline tests — compile-time assertions, stripped from production |
| `11-meta-programming.scrml` | `^{}` meta blocks, `emit()`, `reflect()` — the compiler as a programmable tool |
| `12-snippets-slots.scrml` | Named content slots in components — `slot=`, `${render slotName()}`, snippet props |
| `13-worker.scrml` | `<program name="worker">` — web workers as nested programs with typed messaging |
| `14-mario-state-machine.scrml` | Enum state machine: `type:enum`, payload destructuring, derived machines (§51.9) |
| `15-channel-chat.scrml` | Real-time chat — `<channel>` inside `<program>` for WebSocket sync (Insight 30 placement; auto-sync from being inside channel body — `@shared` modifier removed v0.next) (§38) |
| `16-remote-data.scrml` | Async loading state via enum + `match` (Loading / Ready / Failed pattern). Pattern is canonical scrml; the named `RemoteData:enum` stdlib type itself is specced-not-yet-implemented (§13.5) |
| `17-schema-migrations.scrml` | `<schema>` declarative DB schema — compiler diffs + generates migration SQL (§39) |
| `18-state-authority.scrml` | `<x server>` server-authoritative state (§52 Tier 2, scaffold) |
| `19-lin-token.scrml` | `lin` linear types — exactly-once consumption guarantee (§35) |
| `20-middleware.scrml` | `<program>` middleware attrs + `handle()` escape hatch (§40) |
| `21-navigation.scrml` | `navigate()` + `route` — page transitions, route params (§20) |
| `22-multifile/` | `import`/`export` across .scrml files — pure-type files + component reuse (§21) |
| `23-trucking-dispatch/` | Multi-page reference app (logistics dispatch) — multiple `<page>` files under `routes/`, full-stack with auth + DB + per-page server functions; canonical adopter-scale shape |

Start with `01-hello.scrml` if you want the syntax walkthrough. Start with `03-contact-book.scrml`
if you want the "wait, that's the whole app?" moment.

The interesting examples are 05-08. That's where scrml stops looking like a nicer JSX and starts
looking like a different idea about what a web framework is.

15-18 cover the more advanced patterns — real-time WebSocket sync, async loading state,
declarative schemas, and server-authoritative state. Each demonstrates a single spec section's
canonical pattern.
