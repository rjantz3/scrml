# Known gaps — spec-vs-implementation drift

> **Honest current state.** The README describes the nominal language at the time of any version release ("does not describe what the compiler is perfectly capable of doing"). This document is the running ledger of the largest places where the compiler does NOT yet match the nominal spec. Entries are added as gaps surface (e.g., during dogfood passes, adopter bug reports, audit passes), and removed when the gap closes via a landed implementation arc.
>
> **Severity legend:** HIGH = adopter-visible breakage on a documented pillar feature. MED = silent acceptance + missing safety guarantees. LOW = ergonomic / cosmetic drift.
>
> **Per-gap status:** `spec'd` = SPEC normative + compiler does nothing · `scoping` = SCOPING.md authored, OQs open · `in-impl` = implementation arc actively in flight · `blocked` = waiting on something else

## MED-HI

### Bug 1 — Tailwind arbitrary-value classes silently no-op — `full-fix-shipped` (S108-S109) for grid/flex/aspect + transition/timing + transforms (individual + shorthand + directional) + outline + ring (length/color/var/keyword); ring-offset + gradient + safelist still open

**S109 — `ring-[length|color|var|keyword]` SHIPPED** (commit `6d69534`). Single-property `box-shadow` emit with kind-dispatch — `ring-[3px]` → `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px currentColor`; `ring-[red]` / `ring-[#ff0000]` / `ring-[var(--c)]` → `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px <value>` (3px default width matching Tailwind's named `ring-3`). Variants compose (`md:` / `dark:` / `hover:` / `focus:`). 23 new unit tests at `compiler/tests/unit/bug-1-tailwind-ring-family.test.js`.

**Still deferred (`ring-offset-*` + `bg-gradient-*` + `from-*` / `to-*` / `via-*`):** These require Tailwind's preflight `*, ::before, ::after` custom-property layer (`--tw-ring-offset-shadow` / `--tw-ring-shadow` / `--tw-gradient-stops`). scrml doesn't yet have preflight CSS emission infrastructure. Once that lands, both `ring-offset-*` and the entire gradient family can ride the same machinery.


**S108 — FULL-FIX FOR GRID/FLEX/ASPECT + TRANSITION/TIMING + TRANSFORMS + OUTLINE FAMILIES SHIPPED** in three waves. Wave 1 (S108 `37f8f62`): grid family (`grid-cols-`, `grid-rows-`, `col-span-`, `row-span-`, `col-start/end-`, `row-start/end-`), flex family (`flex-`, `grow-`, `shrink-`, `order-`, `basis-`), aspect family (`aspect-`) + universal underscore-as-space convention + ratio shape `aspect-[16/9]` + grid-track CSS functions (`repeat()`, `minmax()`, `fit-content()`). Wave 2 (S108 v2 follow-on `bdb9287`): transition/timing family (`transition-`, `duration-`, `delay-`, `ease-`) with `cubic-bezier()` + `steps()` function support; modern individual transform props (`rotate-`, `scale-`, `translate-`); outline family (`outline-`, `outline-offset-`). Wave 3 (S108 v3 follow-on): transform shorthand (`transform-[rotate(45deg)_scale(1.5)]`) + directional `translate-x-` / `translate-y-` / `scale-x-` / `scale-y-` (emit modern individual CSS props with single-axis form) + directional `rotate-x-` / `rotate-y-` / `rotate-z-` / `skew-x-` / `skew-y-` (emit `transform: <fn>(...)` shorthand). VALID_MATH_FUNCTIONS expanded with all 2D + 3D transform function names (`rotate`, `scale`, `translate`, `skew`, `rotateX/Y/Z`, etc.).

**FLOOR fix shipped S108** — `W-TAILWIND-UNRECOGNIZED-CLASS` info-level lint (SPEC §34, §26.5). The lint fires on any class-name token in `class="..."` that doesn't resolve via the embedded Tailwind registry. Adopters see compile-time friction at the spot the silent-no-op used to be. Three legitimate causes named in the message (misspelling / unsupported arbitrary-value / custom CSS class). Suppressible per-project via `compilerSettings.lintTailwindUnrecognizedClass = "off"` for adopters whose codebase relies on custom CSS class names (acknowledged false-positive surface). Compiler source at `compiler/src/tailwind-classes.js` (`findUnrecognizedClasses`); 39-test coverage at `compiler/tests/unit/bug-1-tailwind-unrecognized-class.test.js`. Lint and emit share a single source-of-truth via `getTailwindCSS()` — when the engine ships a new family the lint automatically stops firing on it (verified by S108 regression tests).

**S108 full-fix coverage:** 66-test wave-1 + 26-test wave-2 + 23-test wave-3 across `compiler/tests/unit/bug-1-tailwind-{arbitrary-value-emit,minor-families,transform-shorthand}.test.js`.

**Remaining open** — Tailwind compound utilities that DON'T map 1:1 to a single CSS property AND require preflight CSS emission: `ring-offset-*` (offset machinery via `--tw-ring-offset-shadow`) + `bg-gradient-*` / `from-*` / `to-*` / `via-*` (gradient stop-color compound via `--tw-gradient-stops`) + string-shaped values like `content-["text"]` + `font-[Inter]` (quoted strings need bracket-parser extension). All continue firing the lint with the `#{}` workaround. Also still open: safelist / `@apply` mechanism to distinguish custom user-defined classes from typos so the lint is precise on mixed Tailwind+custom-CSS codebases.

**The `*, ::before, ::after` preflight blocker:** Tailwind v3 emits a preflight stylesheet that sets default custom properties on every element (`--tw-ring-inset: ; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: ...; --tw-gradient-from: ...; --tw-gradient-to: ...; --tw-gradient-stops: ...`). The named utilities then write into those custom properties + emit compound declarations like `box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow), var(--tw-ring-shadow), var(--tw-shadow)` that compose three contributions at runtime. scrml currently emits each utility as a self-contained declaration (no shared custom-property layer). The preflight emission would need to fire ONCE per build (not per file) and inject the defaults globally. Filed as a follow-on for ring-offset + gradient ratification.

- **Workaround (for still-deferred families):** drop a `#{}` CSS shim block with the rules written by hand.
- **Reproducer + analysis:** [`handOffs/incoming/read/2026-05-19-0614-side-session-to-scrmlTS-PA-dogfood-bug-surface.md`](../handOffs/incoming/read/2026-05-19-0614-side-session-to-scrmlTS-PA-dogfood-bug-surface.md) §"Bug 1".
- **Status:** FLOOR closed S108; full-fix for grid/flex/aspect + transition/timing + individual transforms + outline + transform shorthand + directional shipped S108; ring (length/color/var/keyword single-property emit) shipped S109; ring-offset + gradient (preflight-blocked) + string-shaped values + safelist still open.

## LOW-MED

### Bug 4 — Bare `/` in markup-text body parses as element closer — `spec'd`

The `?{` half of the original Bug 4 surface closed at S108 via Approach C-narrow (markup-text-mode locus gate per SPEC §3.1 + §8.1). The bare-`/` half remains open. Writing scrml-about-scrml prose where `/` appears in text (e.g., "`""` / `0` / `[]` are all defined values") can still confuse the BS-layer's `looksLikeCloser` heuristic in edge cases. Per the deep-dive's broad-C disposition, this is a refinement of the bare-`/` look-ahead at `block-splitter.js:1962-1987` — additional ~10-20 LOC. Deferred pending friction signal beyond the dogfood report's single citation.

- **Workaround:** entity-encode (`&#47;`) when `/` appears at scrml-content-as-data positions in prose.
- **Reproducer + analysis:** [`handOffs/incoming/read/2026-05-19-0614-side-session-to-scrmlTS-PA-dogfood-bug-surface.md`](../handOffs/incoming/read/2026-05-19-0614-side-session-to-scrmlTS-PA-dogfood-bug-surface.md) §"Bug 4" + deep-dive §"Broad C".
- **Status:** Q-BUG4-OPEN-5 in deep-dive `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/bug-4-docs-mode-escape-2026-05-19.md`; broad-C extension if friction surfaces.

## Closed in S107-S109 (for reference; will rotate out)

- **Bug 2 — Phantom `E-SYNTAX-050` cascade on unpaired quote in markup-text body** — S109 C-narrow fix (commit `204b563`). PA bisecting reducer found the original report's hypothesis (multi-line `<a>` + entity-encoded element-name) was wrong; the actual trigger was any unpaired `'` or `"` in markup-text body (e.g., `<code>X</code>'s` possessive apostrophe-s, `text "with double quote`). Root cause: `block-splitter.js:1059-1095` ran global string-mode tracking in markup-text mode; an unpaired quote eated rest of file as raw content, causing `</p>` (and every other closer) to be missed → unclosed-element cascade with wrong line numbers. Fix: removed the markup-text-level quote-tracking block entirely. Locus argument (sibling to Bug 4 C-narrow at SPEC §4.17, S108): strings live in Logic context + attribute-value scope, not markup-text body. 17 new unit tests at `compiler/tests/unit/bug-2-markup-text-quote-not-tracked.test.js`; 0 regressions; 13,321 / 0 fail post-fix. Regression class (documented): the very rare `paired-quote-/<X-quote` shape in markup-text body now fires E-SYNTAX-050 where it didn't before — workaround `&#47;` / `&lt;` entity-escape.


- **Bug 5 (all phases)** — `${IDENT}` non-reactive interpolation: Phase 1 textContent at DOMContentLoaded (S107 `c70176e`) + Phase 2 Anomalies B+C closure (S107 `a7fbfa8`) + Phase 3 constant-folding (Option γ) + SPEC §7.4.2 normative section (S108). Constants like `const VERSION = "v0.3.0"` + `${VERSION}` now fold inline at compile time — zero placeholder, zero JS wiring, zero runtime cost.
- **Bug 3** — `[BS]` / `[TAB]` diagnostics now carry `file:line:col` prefix matching `[W-LINT-*]` shape (commit `2e9f9c3`)
- **Bug 6** — 2 hallucinated error-code references in `docs/website/pages/` retired to canonical SPEC §34 names (commit `c4d1114`)
- **Match block-form Phases 1+2+3+4+5(partial)** — structural AST node (S107 `82c48fd`) + 5 SYM diagnostics + arm parser + `:`-shorthand recognition (S107 `c91fae0`) + Phase 3 codegen render dispatch with per-arm render fns + variant-guarded dispatcher (S108) + Phase 4 `:`-shorthand body codegen (S108) + **Phase 5 wildcard `<_>` explicit render + full-pipeline integration gap fix (S109 `2691b20`)**. **S109 found + fixed a load-bearing integration gap**: pre-S109, `collectMatchBlocks` walked `fileAST.nodes` but the pipeline passes an outer wrapper with nodes under `fileAST.ast.nodes` — so a REAL compile found zero match-blocks and emitted the mount slot with no dispatcher behind it. Match block-form had never actually worked end-to-end outside the S108 unit tests (which call the codegen helper with the bare AST directly). S109 closes the gap; new full-compile integration tests at `compiler/tests/unit/match-block-phase5-wildcard.test.js §INTEGRATION` are the regression guard. Tier 1 of the case-analysis ladder is now genuinely end-to-end functional for: bare-body markup, self-closing, `:`-shorthand expressions, parenthesized payload bindings, AND wildcard `<_>` catch-all. Phase 5 remaining follow-on (payload-binding typer scope, bare-variant inference in nested expression positions, browser test for runtime arm-swap, samples) deferred to v0.4+.
- **Bug 4 (`?{` half) — markup-text-mode SQL locus gate (Approach C-narrow)** — S108 deep-dive at `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/bug-4-docs-mode-escape-2026-05-19.md` (530 lines) ratified C-narrow per SPEC §3.1 + §8.1 conformance ("SQL is a child of Logic, not markup-text"). Bare `?{` in markup-text body no longer opens an SQL context — adopters writing scrml-about-scrml docs prose can write `?{` literally without the pre-S108 EOF-cascade. 86% of adopter pages (83 of 96) already used entity-escape workarounds — zero migration cost. SPEC §4.17 amended with the locus-gating principle cross-ref. Companion bare-`/` half deferred (Q-BUG4-OPEN-5; broad-C extension if friction surfaces).

## Where this list comes from

- **Dogfood bug reports** filed when the user/PA hits friction on real adopter-shaped work — see `handOffs/incoming/read/` for archived reports.
- **Spec-vs-impl audit passes** when sweeping a SPEC section (e.g., the S107 §18.0 surface audit that discovered the match block-form gap).
- **Adopter bug reports** (none yet; will flow through GitHub Issues when first surfaces).
- **PA self-discovery** during implementation work when a planned fix surfaces a deeper gap (e.g., the W-MATCH-RULE-INERT lint attempt surfacing the broader §18.0.1 unparsed state).

## Where to discuss / report

- New gaps in adopter code: file a GitHub Issue (link TBD; repo at https://github.com/bryanmaclee/scrmlTS)
- Cross-reference with phase status: [`master-list.md`](../master-list.md) §0 LIVE DASHBOARD
- Per-gap implementation arcs: [`docs/changes/`](./changes/) — each gap with an active impl arc has a SCOPING.md + progress.md there
