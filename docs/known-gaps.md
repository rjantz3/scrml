## §1 HIGH — adopter-visible / silent-wrong-output

### Bug 19 — Shape 1 plain reactive cell per-access lifecycle tracker — `RESOLVED S134 (commit fd58893e)` (was HIGH; Q6 prerequisite — now closed)

**Fix (S134 `fd58893e`):** Option α per PA lean — extended `collectStructBindings` to recognize `state-decl` AST nodes (Sub-Pass 2.a; struct-typed Shape 1 case) + authored a NEW cell-value-typed tracker reusing the existing `checkLifecycleBindingAccess` from S131 HU-2 via two additive optional params (`initialStates: Map<string, "pre"|"post">` + `bindingSourceLabel: string`) (Sub-Pass 2.b; cell-value-typed Shape 1 case). Discrimination semantics (Sub-Pass 2.d) fully reused — `given X => {}` / `if (X is not) return` / `match X` / `transition(X)` all apply uniformly. Engine-cell carve-out (Sub-Pass 2.c) preserved — both new collectors skip `engineCellNames`. Two material walker changes: synthetic `{kind:"logic"}` block recursion → block-transparent (state-decl writes visible to subsequent siblings per §6.9 hoisting); `reactive-nested-assign` write node recognized as transition write. Tests: NEW `compiler/tests/unit/lifecycle-shape1-tracker.test.js` (+621L, 25 tests). Baseline 21,676 → 21,701 (+25, 0 fail). Pre-commit gate green on all 7 agent commits + the PA-authored landing.

**Composition with §6.8.3 — Q6-narrow LANDED S135 `2ffe4f6a`.** The tracker observed writes uniformly; Q6-narrow's reset-awareness extended the walker to recognize `reset(@cell)` and `reset(@cell.field)` calls and route through `classifyWriteAgainstSpec` to revert/maintain per-access state per §6.8.3 ratified semantic. Tracker 1 (cell-value Shape 1) + Tracker 2 (struct-typed Shape 1 field lifecycle) both implemented. +25 tests in `compiler/tests/unit/lifecycle-shape1-reset.test.js`; baseline 21,701 → 21,726; zero regressions. Two new heuristic limitations filed as LOW (see §3): deep multi-level reset on nested compound uses `fieldPath[0]`; cross-cell `default=@otherCell` classification is heuristic.

**Deferred items surfaced by B-prereq (NOT regressions; orthogonal limitations):**

1. **Parser tokenizer collapses whitespace around `.` tokens in lifecycle annotations** — `(.Draft to .Published)` becomes `(.Draft to.Published)` at AST level, defeating `findTopLevelArrow`'s space-bounded `to` detection. End-to-end variant-progression on Shape 1 cells with bare-dot annotations therefore goes unrecognized from source form (direct-AST tests work fine — mirrors existing fn-return test pattern). Fix paths: tokenizer-side whitespace preservation OR relax `findTopLevelArrow` to accept one-sided whitespace boundary.
2. **Top-level `let-decl` inside `${...}` blocks doesn't fire** — existing `collectStructBindings` only matches `let-decl` at FN-BODY scope. Pre-existing gap orthogonal to B-prereq; state-decls hoist (closed S134 by this dispatch); let-decls don't.
3. **Qualified-enum form `(Article.Draft to Article.Published)`** — variant-name stripping in `parseLifecycleReturnAnnotation` only removes the leading dot, leaving `Article.Draft` in `preVariantName`. Affects both fn-return and cell-value variant trackers symmetrically.

All three filed in `docs/changes/b-prereq-shape1-lifecycle-tracker-2026-05-26/progress.md` as known follow-ups. None gates Q6-narrow.

### Bug 19 (ORIGINAL ENTRY — S134 surfacing, preserved for forensic) — Shape 1 plain reactive cell per-access lifecycle tracker — `NEW S134; HIGH; impl missing` (Q6 prerequisite)

**Surfaced S134 Q6 dispatch Phase-0 STOP** (`docs/changes/q6-reset-lifecycle-2026-05-26/progress.md`). SPEC §14.12.3 + §14.12.10 (bullet 1) normatively promise per-access lifecycle transition tracking on **Shape 1 plain reactive cells** (`<state>: (not to User) = not`-style decls). The impl tracker today (`compiler/src/type-system.ts` `checkLifecycleFieldAccess`) covers struct-field positions (`User.passwordHash`-style) and fn-return positions (per §14.12.6 hybrid) only — `state-decl` (Shape 1 reactive cell decl) AST nodes are NOT in the tracker's scope.

**Empirically verified by Q6 Phase-0 reproducer:**

```scrml
<state>: (not to User) = not
@state.name   // SHOULD fire E-TYPE-001 per §14.12.10 normative bullet 1; ACTUAL: no fire
```

- **Severity rationale:** HIGH. SPEC §14.12 promises a tracker that doesn't exist for one of the six normatively-supported positions. Adopters writing `<state>: (not to T) = not` get the type-resolution + carve-out (correct) but no pre-transition access enforcement (silently wrong). Exactly the spec-vs-impl drift class Rule 4 is built to catch.
- **Workaround:** wrap state in a single-field struct: `type Holder:struct = { val: (not to User) }; <state>: Holder = { val: not }`. The struct-field tracker DOES fire correctly. Verbose but functional.
- **Reproducer (1-liner):** any `<x>: (A to B) = pre-typed-value` decl followed by `@x.field` access — should fire `E-TYPE-001`, doesn't.
- **Resolution path — B-prereq dispatch (queued S134; pre-Q6-impl):**
  - **Scope:** extend `collectStructBindings` (`type-system.ts:13698`) to recognize `state-decl` AST nodes — OR — author a parallel `state-decl` lifecycle tracker pass. Must cover BOTH the struct-typed Shape 1 case (`<u>: User = ...` with lifecycle on `User.passwordHash`) AND the cell-value-typed Shape 1 case (`<state>: (not to User) = not`) — Q6 Phase-0 verified `collectStructBindings`-extension alone won't cover both.
  - **Estimate:** ~20-30h compiler-source via `scrml-js-codegen-engineer` (isolation:worktree). Unblocks Q6-narrow impl (~10-20h).
  - **Tests:** +N regression-guard covering the 1-liner reproducer + sibling cases (assigning to pre-type satisfies; assigning to post-type triggers).
- **Composition:** §6.8.3 (the symmetric-reset interaction landed S134 SPEC-only) DEPENDS on this tracker — `reset(@cell)` can't revert per-access state on a tracker that doesn't observe per-access state for Shape 1. §6.8.3 stands as the design contract; impl waits for B-prereq.
- **Cross-refs:** SPEC §14.12.3 (extension scope table — Shape 1 listed YES), §14.12.10 (normative statement promising the fire), §6.8.3 (the dependent reset semantic landed S134), Q6 Phase-0 progress.md at `docs/changes/q6-reset-lifecycle-2026-05-26/progress.md`. Authority: const-deep-freeze HU/DD/debate arc S134.

### Bug 17 — E-META-001 only fires in compile-time meta blocks; runtime blocks silently accept JS-host globals — `RESOLVED S134 (commit 6c6c0073)` (was HIGH)

**Surfaced S133 Step A** (commit `80b168e6`) — after closing the META_BUILTINS membership divergence, the Step A agent surfaced a second-order architectural gap. SPEC §22.12 line 14687 reads as **categorical**:

> "JS-host ambient globals (`bun`, `process`, `setInterval`, `fetch`, etc.) are NOT in the META_BUILTINS set and trigger `E-META-001`."

But pre-S134 meta-checker fired E-META-001 only inside **compile-time** meta blocks (`bodyUsesCompileTimeApis === true` from `reflect` / `emit` / `emit.raw` API references). A pure **runtime** meta block — `^{ const x = bun.eval(...); /* no reflect/emit */ }` — got early-returned in `checkMetaBlock` without consulting META_BUILTINS membership. The block emitted unchanged into the generated `_scrml_meta_effect` body. At JS runtime: `bun` is not a Bun-runtime global (only `Bun` capital-B is), so the call **silently failed with ReferenceError** at runtime.

- **Fix (S134 `6c6c0073`):** Approach A — new exported `checkMetaBlockForJsHostGlobals` walker (`compiler/src/meta-checker.ts` +160L) that runs UNCONDITIONALLY on every `^{}` body (compile-time AND runtime), parallel to `checkMetaBlock`. Scans against a new `JS_HOST_FORBIDDEN` Set (9 idents: `bun` / `Bun` / `process` / `console` / `setInterval` / `setTimeout` / `clearInterval` / `clearTimeout` / `fetch`). Respects local-decl shadowing, JS keywords, META_BUILTINS membership; recurses into nested `^{}`. Per-identifier hint messages (timer idents → `meta.interval`/`meta.timeout`; `fetch` → server-fn boundary; rest → generic 'not available'). Wired in `runMetaChecker` between `checkMetaBlock` and `checkReflectCalls` — preserves S133 Step A compile-time semantics verbatim. SPEC §22.11 catalog row broadened to enumerate the three E-META-001 fire conditions (disposition I; closes S114-introduced catalog drift). Regression tests at `compiler/tests/unit/meta-checker-bug17.test.js` (NEW, 33 tests = 1 set composition + 8 idents × runtime-fire + 2 bare-expr + 4 negative controls + 4 diagnostic-message + 1 reproducer end-to-end). Tests: 21,585 → 21,618 (+33, 0 fail). Full-suite gate green.
- **Corpus migration silent under prior gate:** 25 pre-existing tests in `meta-integration.test.js` (13 sites) + `runtime-meta-integration.test.js` (19 sites) used `console.log(...)` inside runtime `^{}` bodies as a "force runtime classification + observe pipeline emission" pattern. Post-fix, these correctly fire E-META-001. Migrated cleanly to `meta.emit(...)` (canonical scrml-native surface per §22.5.1) — semantically equivalent for the codegen-shape assertions these tests carry. Same migration shape adopters with similar test/sample code would need.
- **Open follow-ups (NOT regressions; separate concerns):**
  1. `meta.runtime=false` diagnostic at `meta-checker.ts:~1622` still uses pre-S134 phrasing — broaden for §22.5/§22.11 consistency. Polish.
  2. BS-path: `${ ^{} }` inside `<program>` markup interpolation produces only a `text` node (no meta block enters the pipeline). Latent issue separate from this fix. The canonical V5-strict shape (`p "test"\n^{ ... }\n`) surfaces the meta block correctly.
  3. `compileScrml({source, filePath})` vs `({inputFiles:[filePath]})` API surface divergence — the `source` path may take a shortcut bypassing the meta-checker pipeline. Surfaced for awareness.
- **Self-host parity DEFERRED** post-v1.0 per pa.md — `stdlib/compiler/meta-checker.scrml` + `compiler/self-host/meta-checker.scrml` mirrors carry pre-S134 META_BUILTINS as DATA only (no walker structure).
- **Original brief shape (preserved for forensic):**
  - Move the META_BUILTINS check OUTSIDE the `bodyUsesCompileTimeApis` early-return in `checkMetaBlock` (`compiler/src/meta-checker.ts`) — make it fire E-META-001 for runtime meta blocks too.
    - OR: add a sub-walker that runs unconditionally on every `^{...}` body and checks against META_BUILTINS / known-runtime-meta-API set.
    - Add regression-guard tests covering all 4 removed builtins × runtime context: `process` / `fetch` / `setInterval` / `setTimeout` / `Bun` / `console` (6 cases) inside `^{ ... }` with NO `reflect`/`emit`/`emit.raw` → assert E-META-001 fires.
    - Verify existing 14,566 baseline holds + add new tests (+6-8 logical assertions).
    - Per `feedback_restate_prerequisites_not_conclusions` — restate this entry's pre-dispatch sweep findings in the brief (corpus is empirically clean; no fallout expected).
  - **(c) / (d) REJECTED in deliberation:** (c) had no use case (the `meta.*` API covers runtime needs); (d) is a half-measure that doesn't close the silent-crash class.
- **Cross-refs:** Step A commit `80b168e6` agent report `OPEN follow-ups #1`; SPEC §22.12 line 14687 (the categorical statement); §22.5 + §22.5.1 (runtime meta surface); `compiler/src/meta-checker.ts` `checkMetaBlock` + early-return condition.
- **Not blocking adopters today** — pre-S133 adopters didn't write `bun.eval(...)` (the user-facing surface retired S130); post-S133 they're more likely to hit it via reflex. Watch adopter bug reports for first sighting; treat as load-bearing trigger if it shows up.

### Bug 9 — Compiler-managed async transitive coloring (A9-class) — `deferred`

When a client function calls a server function, the client function should be auto-async-and-awaited (per the "compiler owns the async wiring" pillar). Today the compiler doesn't fully thread this: `scheduling.ts::hasServerCallees` reads `route.functionName` (which is phantom — set in only some pipeline paths). The result: `serverFnNames` is sometimes empty; transitive client functions calling server functions never get `async`/`await` added, and the runtime silently runs the call as sync — returns a `Promise` where the call site expects the resolved value.

- **Workaround:** explicit `async`/`await` in client functions that call server functions (the very thing the language is supposed to do for you). Inelegant; the compiler IS supposed to handle this.
- **Reproducer:** the dashboard cluster (per S126 diagnostic). Any client function in a fn-body that calls a server-classified function.
- **Status:** DEFERRED to A9-class compiler-managed-async work per pa.md Rule 3 (3-layer fix; L3 = NEW transitive async-coloring subsystem; not blind-patched). Filed S126 + carried forward S127-S130. Not in any current implementation arc; queued for v0.7+ post-M6.

### Bug 10 — §29 vanilla-interop — SPEC vs implementation drift — `Nominal / framing-corrected S132`

**Originally (S110):** SPEC §2.1 + §29 asserted in the present tense that plain `.js`/`.html`/`.css` files "are valid alongside `.scrml` files; the compiler processes `.scrml` files and integrates or passes through the rest." Verified S110 the compiler did NOT do this — a pure-vanilla file is rejected (`Cannot find file or directory`); a mixed-project build compiles the `.scrml` and silently DROPS the vanilla files (not copied to dist). The bug was the FALSE present-tense CLAIM, not a missing feature.

- **Workaround:** keep all source in `.scrml`; for vanilla CSS use `#{}` blocks; for vanilla JS use `${}` blocks or `import` from `.js` modules (which IS live + load-bearing per §21).
- **Reproducer:** any project with a `.js` or `.html` file alongside `.scrml`.
- **Status:** **Nominal / framing-corrected S132.** Ratified option (c): the §2.1 false present-tense pass-through claim is REMOVED (reframed to explicit Nominal-future + S132 amendment note), and §29 is MARKED Nominal/spec-ahead-of-implementation (KEPT in SPEC, NOT retired — reaffirms S131 Q-W3-4 defer; re-trigger ≥2 adopter friction reports). NOT "RESOLVED-by-implementation": the feature is still NOT implemented; the spec now honestly says so. Vanilla-JS interop today is via §21 import (live + distinct from §29). The spec no longer makes a false claim, so this is no longer a spec-vs-impl drift — it is correctly-framed-as-Nominal.

### Bug 11 — 6nz-V `class:NAME` on for-lift reused DOM nodes — `confirmed GENUINE`

When a `for...of` loop with `lift` produces DOM nodes that get reused across renders, the `class:NAME` reactive class binding is not re-evaluated against the new iteration item — the original binding's evaluated class state persists on the reused node. Codegen IS correctly per-item-scoped; the gap is in the runtime lift/reconcile path.

- **Workaround:** use static class strings inside for-lift bodies; bind reactive classes outside the loop or via a per-item wrapper component that gets full re-mount.
- **Reproducer:** filed by 6nz S126; `class:active=@item.selected` inside `for (let item of @items) { lift <li class:active=...>...</li> }`.
- **Status:** GENUINE; runtime bug (lift/reconcile path), not codegen. Queued MED; not currently in implementation. Filed S126.

### Bug 12 — E-FN-003 false-positive on attributed-markup-return inside `fn` — `RESOLVED S133 (commit dbef4f4d)` (was HIGH)

A `fn` that returned (or `let`-bound) markup carrying ANY attribute (`class`, `id`, `href`, …) false-fired `E-FN-003: fn body writes to '<attr>'`. The fn-purity write-check `checkOuterScopeMutation` (`compiler/src/type-system.ts` ~12780-12813) ran a text-heuristic `ASSIGN_RE` regex over the SERIALIZED statement text (`nodeText` → `emitStringFromTree`, which re-serializes returned markup including attributes); markup `name="…"` / `name={…}` was indistinguishable from an assignment LHS to that regex. Blocked the canonical "fn returns markup" idiom (PRIMER §6.4 sub-shape 4 / kickstarter §11.11).

- **Fix (S133 `dbef4f4d`):** skip the text heuristic when the statement's serialized text starts with `<` (markup-shaped — `kind:"escape-hatch"` raw markup per `shouldSkipExprParse` at `ast-builder.js:122`). The structured assignment-kind path (`type-system.ts:12785-12798`) and the `@cell`-mutation path (`13013-13064`) are untouched — real purity enforcement preserved. Approach B (predicate-based skip) chosen over Approach A (excise serialized markup substrings) because markup-in-expression-position is stored as escape-hatch raw text, not as structured `kind:"markup"` AST. Regression tests (`compiler/tests/unit/fn-constraints.test.js` §8b — 4 tests incl. negative control asserting `counter = counter + 1` alongside attributed markup STILL fires on `counter`, not `class`). Tests: 21,584 → 21,588 (+4, 0 fail).
- **Known structural gap (separate enhancement):** outer-scope writes embedded inside markup interpolations (e.g. `<a href={counter = counter + 1}>`) are not detected pre- or post-fix; the markup escape-hatch isn't structurally parsed. Pre-fix, the regex's first match captured the attribute name (false-attributing the write); post-fix, the heuristic is skipped on markup-shaped statements. The reactive `@-cell` write path at `13013-13064` similarly doesn't reach into markup interpolations. To close this, the markup escape-hatch ExprNode would need structural parsing — separate enhancement, NOT a regression from this fix.

### Bug 28 — `or` / `and` boolean operators not lowered to `||` / `&&` in derived-cell codegen — `HIGH` (S136 R24)

A `const <derived> = arr.filter(t => cond1 or cond2 and cond3)` style derived cell compiles with exit 0 but emits raw `or` / `and` tokens into the client JS, producing `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'or'` when the runtime loads the chunk. Surfaced by both dev-1-react and dev-4-pascal in gauntlet R24; confirmed independently by 2 overseers.

- **Reproducer:** `const <visibleTickets> = @tickets.filter(t => (@statusFilter is .All or t.status == @statusFilter) and (@searchTerm == "" or t.title.includes(@searchTerm)))` inside a `.scrml` file; compile exits 0; `node --check dist/*.client.js` reports `SyntaxError`. Full reproducer in `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/gauntlet-r24/dev-1-react.scrml` + `dev-4-pascal.scrml`.
- **Spec reference:** SPEC §45 (equality semantics) + §7 (logic contexts) — `or` / `and` are scrml's word-form boolean operators, must lower to JS `||` / `&&`.
- **Current behavior:** derived-cell expression translator emits identifiers verbatim.
- **Expected behavior:** `or` → `||`, `and` → `&&` (word→symbol lowering at the codegen boundary).
- **Suggested fix scope:** likely single-file — codegen translation table for derived-cell expressions (probably in `compiler/src/codegen/emit-expr.ts` or sibling). Highest blast radius of all R24 findings; affects every derived cell with mixed boolean operators.
- **Cross-refs:** R24-BUG-1 in `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/gauntlet-r24-report.md` §"Compiler bugs surfaced".

### Bug 29 — `!{}` handler `{ return }` arm codegen emits `_result = return;` (invalid JS) — `HIGH` (S136 R24)

Any `failableCall() !{ | .Variant -> { return } }` no-op arm body (the canonical "early-return-on-error" idiom per PRIMER §6) compiles with exit 0 but emits `let _scrml__scrml_result_46 = return;` into the client JS, failing `node --check`. Surfaced 8 times in dev-1-react's output alone.

- **Reproducer:** `function load() { const rows = fetchItems() !{ | ::Network msg -> { @phase = .Error(msg); return } | ::Empty -> { @phase = .Empty; return } }; @phase = .Success(rows.length) }` — every `return` in the arm body becomes a `let _result = return;` literal.
- **Spec reference:** SPEC §19.4 (inline handler contract).
- **Current behavior:** error-handler arm lowering binds the entire arm body to a `_result` let, even when the body's terminal statement is `return` (which is a statement, not an expression).
- **Expected behavior:** treat `return` (or `throw`, `break`, `continue`) as a terminating statement; do not bind to `_result`; the parent context already has the early-return semantics.
- **Suggested fix scope:** codegen — error-handler arm lowering; teach the arm-body emitter to detect terminating statements and skip the `_result = ...` wrap. Affects every error-handler arm with a no-op body (the dominant adopter shape).
- **Cross-refs:** R24-BUG-2 in `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/gauntlet-r24-report.md`.

### R24-BUG-4 (cross-ref) — `<match>` block-form `</>` closer rejected with E-CTX-001 — `Phase 5 SCOPING-tracked; HIGH adopter impact`

dev-3-svelte (R24) wrote fully spec-compliant source per SPEC §4.4.2 (`</>` SHALL close innermost open tag — no exceptions) for the `<match for=Type on=val>...</>` block-form. Compiler rejected with `E-CTX-001: Unclosed <match> structural element. Expected explicit close tag '</match>'. The '</>' unambiguous-closer form is not yet supported for <match> at Phase 2 baseline.` PRIMER §6.2 + worked examples use `</>`; the gap is compiler-side, not source-side. dev-3 was the best-case adopter in R24 and got killed by this gap alone.

- **Tracker:** `docs/changes/match-block-form-scoping/SCOPING.md` Phase 5 (already filed; not a new bug entry).
- **R24 escalation:** elevate to HIGH adopter-impact priority — the canon-correct closer was rejected on the cleanest dev's first attempt. Land the Phase 5 work OR update PRIMER §6.2 to show `</match>` as the canon closer until Phase 5 ships.

## §2 MED — silent acceptance / incomplete surfaces

### A5 refinement-type freeze extension — `DEFERRED with adoption-watch trigger` (S134)

The `const <state>` deep-freeze debate (S134) ratified a **sequenced** verdict: A4 (close the L21 walker alias-escape gap) lands NOW; A5 (refinement-type `object(frozen(deep))` extension that emits `Object.freeze` at the JS-host boundary) DEFERS until adopter friction confirms the boundary-zone enforcement is needed.

- **Reproducer (theoretical, not yet adopter-reported):** a scrml object handed across a JS-host boundary (`_{}` foreign code, Web Worker `postMessage`, MCP tool output) can be mutated by the receiving JS code; scrml's L21 compile-time check doesn't survive the boundary because the receiver is JS and doesn't run the scrml compiler.
- **Workaround:** adopters who need defense-in-depth at the JS-host boundary can manually `Object.freeze(...)` before passing values across; the stdlib could expose a `deepFreeze` utility if friction surfaces.
- **Watch trigger:** **≥2 adopter reports of JS-host boundary mutation post-A4** re-opens the A5 dispatch. On trigger, the design approach is the DD's A5 specification (refinement-type predicate extension; emits `Object.freeze` only at the boundary zone; reuses existing §53 three-zone enforcement).
- **What does NOT trigger A5:** internal alias-escape (closed by A4). A3 (Vue-style cell-decl modifier) is permanently rejected per the debate — zero expert votes; creates a parallel classification path beside §53 that the design rule explicitly rejects.

### Bug 1 — Tailwind arbitrary-value classes — `partial-impl` (remaining: ring-offset + gradient + safelist + string-shaped)

Major families shipped S108-S109: grid / flex / aspect / transition / timing / individual transforms + shorthand + directional / outline / ring (length/color/var/keyword). The `W-TAILWIND-UNRECOGNIZED-CLASS` floor lint catches typos + unsupported arbitrary-values today.

**Still open:**
- **`ring-offset-*`** + **`bg-gradient-*` / `from-*` / `to-*` / `via-*`** — require Tailwind's preflight `*, ::before, ::after` custom-property layer (`--tw-ring-offset-shadow` / `--tw-ring-shadow` / `--tw-gradient-stops`). scrml has no preflight CSS emission infrastructure.
- **String-shaped arbitrary values** — `content-["text"]` + `font-[Inter]` need bracket-parser extension.
- **Safelist / `@apply`** — to distinguish custom user-defined classes from typos so the lint is precise on mixed Tailwind+custom-CSS codebases.

- **Workaround:** drop a `#{}` CSS shim block with the rules written by hand.
- **Status:** preflight blocker is the load-bearing piece; ring-offset + gradient unblock together when preflight infrastructure lands. Filed S108-S109; queued.

### Bug 12 — V-kill READ-side fire — `deferred`

S123 V-kill landed write-side enforcement (`@x = expr` at default-logic body-top fires `E-WRITE-NOT-IN-LOGIC-CONTEXT`). The READ-side fire (rejecting bare `@x` reads against undeclared cells inside `${...}` bodies) is deferred — the engine var-name canonicalization machinery is the unblocker.

- **Workaround:** declare all cells structurally with `<x> = init` before reading via `@x` in `${...}` bodies (which is the canonical V5-strict pattern anyway; the workaround IS the correct usage).
- **Status:** deferred S123; engine var-name canonicalization unblocks. Not adopter-visible if V5-strict patterns are followed; only surfaces if adopter typos `@x` against a name that doesn't have a `<x>` decl.

---

### Bug 13 — E-SCHEMA-003 enforcement — `spec'd` (no fire site)

S130 HU-2 Q7 ratified `<schema>` placement as immediate child of `<program>` (per F-019). SPEC §34 E-SCHEMA-003 catalog row updated S130. The compiler currently has NO fire site for E-SCHEMA-003 — a misplaced `<schema>` block compiles clean and emits unexpected SQL/runtime behavior instead of the loud compile error the SPEC promises.

- **Workaround:** verify `<schema>` is an immediate child of `<program>` at write-time; if you see runtime SQL anomalies in mixed-placement projects, check schema placement first.
- **Status:** flagged at S130 HU-2 Q7 as Phase 2 implementation follow-on. Filed; not yet dispatched.

### Bug 14 — MCP V0 partial-impl + deferred items — `partial-impl`

MCP V0 sub-units A+B+C+D shipped S125-S130. V0.E (E2E + adopter docs + fixture multi-page app) pending. V0.D (this session S130) has 3 deferred items that limit current capability:

1. **Runtime-helper registration on globalThis** — today's boot reads `globalThis._scrml_reactive_get` which is never set (runtime is module-scoped per generated `.server.js`). Tool resolvers gracefully degrade for V0 (descriptor sidecars carry topology data; runtime cell reads return undefined).
2. **`scrml dev` (in-process Bun.serve)** gets NO MCP wiring — boot lives only in build-time `_server.js`. Use `scrml build` + run the server entry to get MCP working in dev.
3. **"dev-only" semantics use RUNTIME NODE_ENV gate** (not compile-time) — no §58 Build Story hook exists yet; revisit when §58 implementation lands.

- **Workaround:** for V0.E specifically, no workaround — the adopter setup doc + E2E examples don't exist. For deferred items: use `<program mcp="always">` to override the dev-only gate; build via `scrml build` not `scrml dev`.
- **Status:** V0.E queued (~10-12h per SCOPING §3.E). Deferred items revisit at §58 land.

### Bug 16 — Generator policy — `open` (S114)

`yield` / `yield*` / `function*` are NOT covered by the S114 "no async/await" rule (preserved in the JS-subset bound at M4.3 per S114). Semantic policy is open: do generators belong in scrml, and if so under what discipline (compiler-managed iteration vs user-authored protocol)?

- **Workaround:** use generators if needed; they parse. Compiler doesn't generate diagnostic surface around them either way.
- **Status:** open. Filed S114; not dispatched.

---

### Bug 17 — L19 multi-statement-handler relaxation — `queued for HU`

L19 forbids multi-statement event handlers (`onclick=` must be a single expression, not a multi-statement block). The rule was ratified pre-engines; engines + body-split CPS may have changed the design constraints. Carry-forward question: should L19 relax under modern scrml composition?

- **Workaround:** wrap multi-statement handlers in a named function (`function handle() { ... }; <button onclick=handle()>`).
- **Status:** open HU follow-on; small enough to fold into iteration HU or its own sub-session.

### Bug 30 — Linter scans content inside `<!-- -->` HTML comment blocks — `MED` (S136 R24)

The lint pass fires `W-LINT-001` / `W-LINT-005` / `W-LINT-007` / `W-LINT-011` / `W-LINT-014` / `W-LINT-022` on text appearing inside HTML comment blocks (`<!-- ... -->`). Surfaced by dev-2, dev-3, dev-4 overseers in R24 — every dev's friction-report comment block (which contains anti-pattern words like `===`, `<style>`, `.map()`, `{#if}` for comparison purposes) tripped multiple lints.

- **Reproducer:** any `.scrml` file containing `<!-- comment with === or .map() text -->`; lints fire on the comment-internal content.
- **Spec reference:** SPEC §27 — comment content is opaque to all stages.
- **Current behavior:** linter walks text without comment-region awareness.
- **Expected behavior:** skip lint scanning inside `<!-- -->` regions.
- **Suggested fix scope:** linter — add comment-region awareness to the lint scanner. Single-file fix in lint pass.
- **Cross-refs:** R24-BUG-3 in `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/gauntlet-r24-report.md`.

### Bug 31 — `if`-statement-as-expression in `!{}` result binding produces invalid JS — `MED` (S136 R24)

A function body containing `if (cond) return` immediately followed by a `failableCall() !{...}` causes codegen to bind the entire sequence as `let _result = if (cond) { return fn(); }` — an `if` statement in expression position, which is a JS SyntaxError. Narrow but adopter-encounterable.

- **Reproducer:** dev-1-react's `function load() { if (!@searchTerm) return; const r = fetchItems() !{ ... }; }` surfaces this.
- **Spec reference:** SPEC §19.4 (failable function + handler contract) + §17 (control flow).
- **Current behavior:** codegen wraps the early-return `if` into the `_result` binding.
- **Expected behavior:** treat the early-return `if` as a separate statement; the `_result` binding scope begins AFTER it.
- **Suggested fix scope:** codegen — result-binding scope semantics in failable-handler-result lowering.
- **Cross-refs:** R24-BUG-5 in `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/gauntlet-r24-report.md`.

### Bug 32 — `@.` iteration sigil not lowered inside `<tableFor>` column slot body — `MED` (S136 R24)

A `<column field="status" :let={(row) => <span>${@.status}...}/>` inside a `<tableFor for=T rows=@cell>` block emits `@ . status` unlowered into the client JS — the iteration-scope binding doesn't reach into the L22 column slot. Surfaced by dev-1-react overseer.

- **Reproducer:** dev-1-react's `tableFor` column slot uses `${@.}` to access the per-row binding; emitted JS contains literal `@` token.
- **Spec reference:** SPEC §17 (`@.` iteration semantics) + §41.16.3 (`tableFor` column slot grammar).
- **Current behavior:** iteration-scope binding pass doesn't recognize the L22 column slot as an iteration locus.
- **Expected behavior:** `@.` inside `<column :let={(row) => ...}>` lowers to the iteration-bound row.
- **Suggested fix scope:** codegen — iteration-scope binding inside L22 column slot context.
- **Cross-refs:** R24-BUG-6 in `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/gauntlet-r24-report.md`.

## §3 LOW — ergonomic / cosmetic

### Bug 4 — Bare `/` in markup-text body parses as element closer — `spec'd`

The `?{` half closed S108 via Approach C-narrow (markup-text-mode locus gate per SPEC §3.1 + §8.1). Bare `/` half remains open. Writing scrml-about-scrml prose where `/` appears in text (e.g., "`""` / `0` / `[]` are all defined values") can still confuse the BS-layer's `looksLikeCloser` heuristic in edge cases.

- **Workaround:** entity-encode (`&#47;`) when `/` appears at scrml-content-as-data positions in prose.
- **Status:** Q-BUG4-OPEN-5 in deep-dive `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/bug-4-docs-mode-escape-2026-05-19.md`; broad-C extension if friction surfaces beyond the single dogfood citation.

---

### Bug 18 — GITI-015 — `queued`

LOW-severity adopter bug filed by giti per S124 carry-forward. Details in `handOffs/incoming/read/`. Queued; not currently in implementation.

---

### Bug 19 — §11-folded-citation sweep — `cosmetic`

5 dev.to articles cite SPEC `§11` for `<db>` / `protect=` / state-authority content. §11 is folded (content distributed to §6.12 + §52 per SPEC-INDEX row 44). The E-codes those articles cite are correct; only the bare section number is stale. Lowest-priority cleanup item.

- **Workaround:** none needed; the articles' E-code citations still resolve.
- **Status:** filed S115 article-truthfulness audit §3.4; safe to fold into any future article edit pass; not dispatched separately.

---

### Bug 20 — `bun scrml promote --engine` (Tier-1→2 sibling) — `deferred`

The `bun scrml promote --match` CLI shipped S66 (Tier-0→1 lift mechanical). The companion `--engine` flag (Tier-1→2 lift) is deferred — it pairs with `W-MATCH-TRANSITIONS-ACCRUING`, a sibling lint that needs its own §34 catalog + implementation groundwork. The CLI flag stays registered but prints a clear "deferred" message until that lands.

- **Workaround:** manual conversion from `<match for=Type>` block-form to `<engine for=Type initial=.Variant>` — state-children carry forward verbatim; add `initial=` + per-arm `rule=`.
- **Status:** deferred; queued post-W-MATCH-TRANSITIONS-ACCRUING.

---

### Bug 21 — Q6-narrow heuristic: deep multi-level reset on nested compound — `heuristic` (S135)

`reset(@a.b.c)` where `b` is itself a compound state with its own lifecycle-annotated fields: Q6-narrow's `applyResetToCellField` walker conservatively uses `fieldPath[0]` — the first hop after the cell root — for tracker classification. The §6.8.2 B22 ratification supports deeper compound-nav targets, but the canonical scrml idiom is one hop deep (per the §6.8.2 worked examples). Deeper nesting works at runtime via the existing `_scrml_reset` codegen; only the per-access tracker's state revert is shallow.

- **Workaround:** none needed for canonical idiom; if deeper resets are exercised, the tracker may miss a lifecycle revert on the deeper field but the runtime behavior is correct.
- **Status:** filed S135 in Q6-narrow progress.md follow-ups; extend on real adopter friction.
- **Cross-refs:** SPEC §6.8.2 (multi-level compound-nav, B22 ratification); SPEC §6.8.3 (Q6-narrow impl); `docs/changes/q6-narrow-reset-lifecycle-2026-05-26/progress.md`.

---

### Bug 22 — Q6-narrow heuristic: cross-cell `default=@otherCell` reset value classification — `heuristic` (S135)

`<state default=@otherCell>: (not to User) = not` — when `reset(@state)` evaluates `@otherCell` as the reset value, `classifyResetValueAgainstSpec` heuristically treats any non-`not` text as post-type for presence-progression. If `@otherCell` is itself in a pre-state at the reset moment, the heuristic misclassifies. The actual cross-cell type-check happens at the assignment site (`@state = @otherCell` would route through `classifyWriteAgainstSpec` properly); the heuristic only affects whether the per-access tracker reverts vs maintains state immediately after the reset.

- **Workaround:** none needed in practice; the cross-cell scenario is uncommon and the type-check at the assignment site catches real type errors.
- **Status:** filed S135 in Q6-narrow progress.md follow-ups; extend when adopters exercise cross-cell defaults under lifecycle annotations.
- **Cross-refs:** SPEC §6.8.1 (`default=` attribute); SPEC §6.8.3 (Q6-narrow impl); `docs/changes/q6-narrow-reset-lifecycle-2026-05-26/progress.md`.

### Bug 23 — Lifecycle source-form follow-up: W-LIFECYCLE-LEGACY-ARROW not emitted for Shape 1 cells — `heuristic` (S135)

The legacy-arrow lint (`W-LIFECYCLE-LEGACY-ARROW`, advising migration from `->` to `to` glyph in lifecycle annotations) fires today only on struct-field positions where the legacy glyph appears in struct-body lifecycle declarations. Shape 1 cell-typed lifecycle annotations (`<phase>: (.Draft -> .Published) = ...`) parse via `findTopLevelArrow` but do not emit the lint when the legacy glyph is used. The S135 source-form follow-ups landing (`a7167b6b` Fix #1) added whitespace tolerance to `findTopLevelArrow` but didn't extend lint-emission to the Shape 1 site.

- **Workaround:** prefer the canonical `to` glyph from the start; if you have a legacy `->` in a Shape 1 lifecycle annotation, the tracker still recognizes it (per `findTopLevelArrow`) but you won't get the migration nudge.
- **Status:** filed S135 in lifecycle-source-form-followups progress.md; extend on real adopter friction.
- **Cross-refs:** SPEC §14.12.4 (`(A to B)` glyph; `->` is legacy with W-LIFECYCLE-LEGACY-ARROW); `docs/changes/lifecycle-source-form-followups-2026-05-26/progress.md`.

---

### Bug 24 — Lifecycle source-form follow-up: qualified-form discrim regex tolerance — `heuristic` (S135)

The discrimination walker (`checkLifecycleBindingAccess`) recognizes bare-dot variant form `if (X is .Variant)` for advancing per-access state to "post." It does NOT recognize the qualified form `if (X is Article.Draft)` — the regex matches only `.Variant` patterns. Adopters using the qualified form for discrimination won't get the tracker's "post" advance and will see spurious E-TYPE-001 fires after the discrimination branch.

- **Workaround:** use bare-dot form in discrimination expressions (`if (@phase is .Draft)`) — equivalent to qualified per §14.10 bare-variant inference (M9).
- **Status:** filed S135 in lifecycle-source-form-followups progress.md; close on real adopter friction.
- **Cross-refs:** SPEC §14.10 (bare-variant inference); SPEC §14.12.6 (discrimination forms); `docs/changes/lifecycle-source-form-followups-2026-05-26/progress.md`.

---

### Bug 25 — Lifecycle source-form follow-up: `transition()` with deeper expressions — `heuristic` (S135)

`TRANSITION_CALL_RE` matches single-identifier arguments only — `transition(phase)`, `transition(@phase)` (S135 fix). It does NOT match deeper expressions like `transition(@u.field)` or `transition(items[0])`. Adopters using compound-nav target expressions in transition calls won't get the tracker's state advance.

- **Workaround:** factor the target into a local binding first: `let p = @u.field; transition(p)` (caveat: this changes semantics depending on the surrounding scope; works in many cases but not all).
- **Status:** filed S135 in lifecycle-source-form-followups progress.md; extend on real adopter friction. Canonical scrml usage today is single-identifier transition targets.
- **Cross-refs:** SPEC §14.12.6 (transition forms); `docs/changes/lifecycle-source-form-followups-2026-05-26/progress.md`.

---

### Bug 26 — `${...}` inside `function probe() { ... }` body emits E-SCOPE-001 for `$` — `LOW` (S135)

A `${...}` block placed inside a bare `function name() { ... }` body emits an unexpected `E-SCOPE-001` diagnostic for the leading `$` character. The `${` token gets preprocessed differently inside function bodies vs at structural positions. Unrelated to the silent-swallow class that S135 structural-in-logic landing closed — surfaced as a Phase 0 probe side-finding.

- **Workaround:** don't nest `${...}` inside a bare `function` body — use `${...}` at structural positions (inside `<program>`, `<page>`, etc.), or use bare statements inside the function body (no `${...}` wrapper needed since the function body is already in code-context).
- **Status:** filed S135 in structural-in-logic progress.md; orthogonal to silent-swallow class. Extend on real adopter friction.
- **Cross-refs:** `docs/changes/structural-in-logic-body-2026-05-26/progress.md`.

---

### Bug 27 — `tryParseStructuralDecl` extra lookahead on structural-element compound forms — `cleanup` (S135)

`tryParseStructuralDecl` enters the compound-state-decl branch when it sees `<schema><users>...` (treating it as a potential compound state-decl with field `users`), then rewinds when the child `<users>` doesn't have an `=` RHS. Works correctly (the rewind handles it; the parent eventually emits `E-STRUCTURAL-ELEMENT-MISPLACED` per the S135 structural-in-logic fix) but does extra lookahead work that could be short-circuited by checking the leading-tag name against the structural-element registry FIRST.

- **Workaround:** none needed — current behavior is correct; only the lookahead cost is wasted.
- **Status:** filed S135 in structural-in-logic progress.md as a cleanup opportunity. Not a bug. Extend on parser-performance signal.
- **Cross-refs:** `docs/changes/structural-in-logic-body-2026-05-26/progress.md`.

---

### Bug 33 — W-LINT-011 false positive on `:let={}` slot-binding shape — `LOW` (S136 R24)

`W-LINT-011` flags `:let={(row) => ...}` (the canonical `<column>` slot-binding shape per SPEC §41.16.3 + §16.6) as Vue-style `:`-prefixed binding. The pattern-matcher distinguishes `:let=` insufficiently from `:disabled=` / `:value=` etc.

- **Workaround:** none — lint is noise; valid syntax.
- **Status:** lint noise only; doesn't block compile.
- **Spec reference:** SPEC §41.16.3 + §16.6 (`tableFor` column slot grammar with `:let=` row binding).
- **Suggested fix scope:** linter — narrow the `:VAR=` Vue-shape pattern to exclude `:let=` (and any other reserved scrml `:`-prefixed slot-binding forms).
- **Cross-refs:** R24-BUG-7 in `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/gauntlet-r24-report.md`.

### Bug 34 — Shape-2 compound markup-init emits empty 2nd arg to `_scrml_reactive_set` — `LOW` (S136 R24)

A Shape-2 compound state cell like `<form><title>= <input type="text"/></form>` (compound with markup init on a field) emits `_scrml_reactive_set("newTicketForm.title", )` — the 2nd argument is empty. Surfaced by dev-4-pascal overseer.

- **Reproducer:** in dev-4-pascal.scrml — Shape-2 compound `<newTicketForm>` with markup-init fields.
- **Spec reference:** SPEC §6.2 Shape 2 (decl-coupled-with-render-spec) — the init value should be the bind-source for the input.
- **Current behavior:** Shape-2 compound init handler doesn't pass the render-spec init value through.
- **Expected behavior:** the markup init value is the bind-source; emit `_scrml_reactive_set("newTicketForm.title", "")` (or the appropriate init).
- **Suggested fix scope:** codegen — Shape-2 compound init handler.
- **Cross-refs:** R24-BUG-8 in `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/gauntlet-r24-report.md`.

## §4 Nominal — SPEC sections deliberately spec-ahead-of-implementation

These are SPEC-only surfaces — designed, normatively documented, NOT yet implemented in the compiler. The author has explicitly ratified them as "spec-ahead-of-implementation" (Nominal sections). Adopters should treat as roadmap, not present capability.

### Nominal-1 — Build Story §58 — `nominal`

S118 landed SPEC §58 "Build Story" as a Nominal section. Compilation as a pure function `compile(source, buildStory) → artifact`; content-addressed Merkle closure (Approach B); `[story]` manifest table; per-`<program>` `story=` attribute; `build-story.lock` sidecar; cryptographic SHA-256 closure hash. **No compiler implementation exists.** Includes a §58.12 determinism-gap analysis flagging the `*`-marked claims.

- **Status:** Nominal. Implementation arc estimated ~90-200h (per S124 build-story-research-roughing); M6-gated (M6 cutover precedes substantive build-story work).

### Nominal-2 — `import:host` §21.3.1 — `nominal`

S114 ratified `import:host` declaration form as the manifest-gated self-host bootstrap bridge (Approach C carve-out). **Zero references in `compiler/native-parser/` or `compiler/src/`** per S129 D8b finding — the syntax is SPEC-only.

- **Status:** Nominal. Implementation arc is part of the self-host bootstrap migration (post-v1.0 — see master-list).

### Nominal-3 — Quoted-text model §4.18 compiler fire — `nominal`

SPEC §4.18 landed Wave 1 S111 — the code-default body mode + `"..."` display-text literal + `E-UNQUOTED-DISPLAY-TEXT` error code. The compiler fire is spec-ahead-of-implementation; Waves 2+ ship with the native parser (v0.4.x → v0.5).

- **Status:** Nominal until native parser default-flip + quoted-text BS-retrofit / native-implementation lands. The examples in dev.to articles + samples that show bare display prose inside engine/match arm bodies are NOT wrong against today's compiler.

### Nominal-4 — `_{}` foreign code — `nominal`

§23 — embed non-JS code inline with level-marked braces (`_{}`/`_={...}=`). Enables inline Rust, Python, SQL extensions. Specced, not yet implemented.

### Nominal-5 — WASM call-char sigils — `nominal`

§23.3 — single-character sigils (`r{}`, `c{}`, `z{}`) for invoking compiled WASM functions from Rust, C, Zig. Specced, not yet implemented.

### Nominal-6 — Sidecar process declarations — `nominal`

§23.4 — `use foreign:name { fn }` for declaring server-side sidecar processes (HTTP/socket services). Specced, not yet implemented.

### Nominal-7 — `RemoteData` enum — `nominal`

§13.5 — built-in `Loading / Loaded(T) / Failed(Error)` enum for modeling async fetch state. Pattern-matchable with exhaustive checking. Specced, not yet implemented.

## §5 Lifecycle annotation surface — DOC arc closed; IMPL has a remaining gap (S134 finding)

S130 lifecycle DD + HU-1 ratified `(A to B)` extension scope to non-engine cells (Approach C); 4 landings shipped, ONE prerequisite-impl gap surfaced S134:

Baseline 21,701 → 21,726; zero regressions. Closes §6.8.3 SPEC-ahead-of-impl bullet. Two heuristic limitations filed as LOW. |
| **Source-form follow-ups (S135)** | `findTopLevelArrow` whitespace tolerance + `parseLifecycleReturnAnnotation` qualified-enum stripping + diagnostic preLabel + `TRANSITION_CALL_RE` `@` prefix tolerance — closes the source-form gap for Shape 1 variant-progression lifecycle annotations (`(.Draft to .Published)` + `(Article.Draft to Article.Published)` forms both work end-to-end from source now) | **SHIPPED S135** (`a7167b6b` + `fefecb1b` + `a5feca4b` + `1f6cc614`) — three surgical fixes + 17 new source-form tests in `compiler/tests/unit/lifecycle-shape1-source-form.test.js`. Baseline 21,726 → 21,743; zero regressions. Three new heuristic limitations filed as LOW (Bug 23/24/25). |

**S131:**
- **Bug 15 (MED) — `~snapshot` raw-sigil codegen leak** — SHIPPED per HU-5 Q-W35-1 (a) ratification. Two-part defensive codegen fix: (1) `emit-logic.ts:bare-expr` skips the spurious orphan `~` bare-expr the live parser peels off `~snapshot = {...}` leads; (2) `emit-expr.ts:emitIdent` adds a defensive marker `null /* ~ orphaned — codegen-fallback */` for any nested-expression orphan that bypasses the bare-expr branch. Regression test `compiler/tests/integration/tilde-snapshot-codegen-fix.test.js` (3 tests, all pass). SPEC §32 unchanged per pa.md Rule 4 — `~snapshot` is NOT a new language form; the native parser already handles the unified `~ IDENT = expr` lead, mirroring that in the live parser surfaceable as a separate follow-up. Closes the S125 Wave 14 DD-surfaced silent-correctness class for the tilde-decl reactive-deps path.

**S130:**
- **Bug 8 (HIGH) — E-TYPE-001 lifecycle access-before-transition fire** — Landing 1 SHIPPED (`1feaedc9`). Per-access transition-state tracking implemented in `compiler/src/type-system.ts` (+666 LOC + design pick β symbol-table side-table mirroring `checkFunctionBodyStateCompleteness` precedent). +33 new tests (27 unit / 6 integration) / +50 expect() calls. Closes the ~6+ week SPEC §14.3 line 7106 spec-vs-impl gap that the mutability-contracts article publish-twin's status banner had been acknowledging. Diagnostic message names binding + field name + struct type + pre-state type + post-state type + resolution path + SPEC anchor. Landing 2 (extension to non-engine cell positions + `->` → `to` glyph migration + engine-cell rejection diagnostic) queued.
- **Phase 2 Cluster A — V-kill SPEC sweep** — A1-A6 all 6 amendments landed (`b0244869`). Grammar production relocated to §6.1.5; §52.4.1 grammar folds in; ~90 worked-example sites migrated SPEC-wide. Closes F-001 / F-008 / F-009 / F-016 (1a/1b LB).
- **Phase 2 Cluster B-code — Approach C source-cascade** — 9 of 10 sites cleaned (`35262911`). Site 1 (`rewriteBunEval` function retirement) DEFERRED pending three prerequisite sub-tasks (META_BUILTINS purge → 5 meta-eval call drops → Pass 4 drop + test retire). Agent's Phase-0 root-cause confirmation caught the brief's "zero callers" assumption was wrong (7 active callers); banked-rule earning its keep. Closes F-002 / F-003 / F-009 (1a) / F-010 (compiler half).
- **F-021 PIPELINE `deriveEngineVarName`** — PIPELINE doc-only fix per HU-2 Q6 ratification. Compiler already aligned with SPEC §51.0.C.
- **F-019 `<schema>` placement** — SPEC §39 prose rewrite per HU-2 Q7 ratification (no longer documents "alongside not inside"; immediate child of `<program>`). E-SCHEMA-003 catalog row updated. (Compiler-side enforcement still open — see Bug 13.)
- **F-018 §55.5 validity surface predictability** — SPEC + PIPELINE prose alignment per HU-2 Q8. Compiler already implements unconditional synthesis.
- **F-003 Approach C SPEC subsumption** — §22.4 + §30 + §7.2 + §22.12 + §34 amendments per HU-2 Q4 ratification. `bun.eval()` retires as user-facing surface. (Compiler-source cleanup of 8 sites in flight S130 Cluster B-code dispatch.)
- **MCP V0.D** — `<program mcp>` attribute wiring + auto-install per SCOPING §3.D. (V0.E still pending — see Bug 14.)
- **Lifecycle annotation HU-1** — 7 ratifications closed; Phase 2 amendment scope crystallized (3 landings).

**S129:**
- **HU-2 batch (6 questions + lifecycle thread)** — F-001 / F-008 / F-009 / F-016 V-kill cluster ratifications; F-023 + F-024 lifecycle annotation flagship + `(A to B)` syntax.
- **D8a-i function `-> ReturnType` annotation** — native parser fix; 4 corpus files closed; +21 tests.

**S128:**
- **D3 `:>`-arm separator** — native parseMatchArm now accepts `:>` per live-parity.
- **D6 string-literal import specifier** — `import { "kebab" as alias }` per SPEC §38.12.5.
- **D7 `given` presence-guard** — `given ident => { body }` per §42.2.3.

**S126:**
- **Bug W (CRITICAL)** — precedence-aware `emitBinary`; `(2+3)*4` no longer silently drops grouping parens.
- **GITI-017 (CRITICAL silent-corruption class)** — `not` keyword no longer corrupts regex literals; lowering pass now skips regex bodies + comments + string interiors.
- **6nz-P** — runtime chunker tree-shake gap; declarative `CHUNK_DEPENDENCIES` table with `scope → [timers, animation]` edge.
- **GITI-019** — lift-loop coalesce parens before `?? ""`.
- **GITI-018** — multi-`scrml:` library-mode imports now all rewrite.
- **6nz-S** — `return not` statement-glue at both lowering sites.

**S123:**
- **Bug Q (V-kill / Unit CC)** — silent runtime → loud compile error. Bare `@x = expr` at default-logic body-top fires `E-WRITE-NOT-IN-LOGIC-CONTEXT`.

**S110-S122:**
- Native parser arc M1-M3 + MK1-MK3 (compiler-internal; opaque to adopters except as parse-completeness wins)
- v0.4.0 / v0.5.0 / v0.6.0 release cuts (S114/S115/S118)
- L22 family — formFor (S102-103) + schemaFor (S104) + tableFor (S105)
- Match block-form Phase 3+4+5 codegen
- Tailwind arbitrary-value families (grid / flex / aspect / transition / transforms / outline / ring length/color/var/keyword) — Bug 1 partial-impl per §2

## §8 Where this list comes from

- **Dogfood bug reports** filed when the user/PA hits friction on real adopter-shaped work — see `handOffs/incoming/read/` for archived reports.
- **Spec-vs-impl audit passes** when sweeping a SPEC section (e.g., the S107 §18.0 surface audit that discovered the match block-form gap; the S129 grammar-consolidation Phase 1a/1b/1c audits).
- **Adopter bug reports** (6nz + giti to date; queued in `handOffs/incoming/read/`).
- **PA self-discovery** during implementation work when a planned fix surfaces a deeper gap (e.g., the W-MATCH-RULE-INERT lint attempt surfacing the broader §18.0.1 unparsed state; S130 lifecycle DD surfacing the E-TYPE-001 unimplemented fire).
- **Deep-dive critical findings** (e.g., S130 lifecycle DD's `type-system.ts:1444` per-access transition-state gap).

## §9 Where to discuss / report
