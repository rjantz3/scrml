# SPEC Consolidation — Heads-Up Resolutions (Phase 2)

This is the running log of per-finding resolution decisions for the SPEC consolidation effort. Each HU-N sub-session resolves one or more findings from the Phase 1a + Phase 1b audits. When a finding is closed here, Phase 3 (example coverage / SPEC amendment / canon migration) executes against the direction recorded.

**Conventions:**
- HU-N = heads-up sub-session N. Sequentially numbered.
- Each HU section records: questions discussed, decisions ratified (verbatim user direction where applicable), findings closed / advanced, carry-forward open items, and next-HU candidate questions.
- Option labels: ASCII letters `(a)` / `(b)` / `(c)` or short words — NEVER Greek (per [[feedback_no_greek_chars_in_options]] — user can't type them on their keyboard).
- Final resolution direction is reproduced here verbatim so Phase 3 work has a single source of truth. The audit docs are the EVIDENCE chain; this doc is the DECISIONS chain.

## HU-1 — 2026-05-25 — Mental-model anchors + F-003 ratification

### Questions discussed

**Q1 (user):** *"is `: string? ` syntactic suguar for `: not -> string` ?"*

**Q2 (user):** *"`^{}` Im not sure if I have gone back and forth on this or if I was along for the ride (my fault). the way I see it (now at least) is that the up arrow is like saying 'go over his head'. does that make sense?"*

### Q1 resolution — `string?` is sugar for `string | not` (union, not arrow)

**SPEC §7.5 line 5573 is authoritative:** *"`T?` sugar. Postfix `?` is syntactic sugar for `T | not`. The compiler desugars before type checking."*

In code:
```scrml
<selected>: string? = not
// desugars to
<selected>: string | not = not
```

The `not -> string` phrasing in Q1 was an informal sketch; `->` in scrml is the function return-type arrow (`function f() -> string { ... }`), not a union connector. PA confirmed the union reading; user's mental model is anchored.

**Implicit ratification carried by Q1:** the migration target for the V-kill cluster (F-001 / F-008 / F-009 / F-016) uses `<x>: string? = not` syntax — user did not contest the migration shape, only the desugaring semantics. The V-kill direction (amend §7.5 grammar production + ~30 worked examples + §52.4.1 sibling to V5-strict structural form) is implicit-confirmed for HU-2 finalization but not yet executed.

### Q2 resolution — `^{}` mental model anchored to S114 Approach C

**The user's mental model:** *"the up arrow is like saying 'go over his head'"*. PA confirmed this matches Approach C (S114) when read as **"go over the runtime's head"** — `^{}` is the compile-time context. Code inside runs DURING COMPILATION, not at app-runtime. The compiler reads it, evaluates it, and inlines the result.

**NOT "over the language's head"** — Approach C explicitly closed the JS-host escape path (pre-S114 proposals that permitted `await import(...)`, `bun.eval()`, host ambient globals). Per SPEC §22.12: *"The general-developer `^{}` body parser SHALL accept only scrml-native + this enumerated primitive set; JS-host ambient globals (`bun`, `process`, `setInterval`, `fetch`, etc.) are NOT in the META_BUILTINS set and trigger E-META-001."*

What's IN (S114 closed set):
```scrml
^{
    const fields = reflect(User).fields           // compile-time introspection
    emit(`<input name="${field.name}"/>`)         // compile-time markup gen
    const userType = reflect(User)                // scrml-native + 3 compile-time primitives
}
```

What's OUT:
```scrml
^{
    const config = await import("./config.js")    // E-AWAIT-NOT-IN-SCRML
    const year = bun.eval("Date.now()")           // E-META-001
    const data = await fetch(url)                 // E-META-001
}
```

### F-003 RATIFICATION — disposition (a) "subsume" — Approach C subsumes §30.2

**User ratification (verbatim, HU-1):** *"a"* (with note: user keyboard can't type Greek characters; PA banked the rule [[feedback_no_greek_chars_in_options]] going forward).

**Decision:** Approach C extends transitively to `${}` markup interpolation. `bun.eval()` retires as a user-facing surface entirely. The "over the runtime's head" reading from Q2 applied uniformly: `bun.eval()` is JS-host runtime escape, not compile-time meta — doesn't belong in EITHER `^{}` body OR `${}` interpolation.

**Concrete mechanical migrations this ratification triggers:**

1. **SPEC §22.4 line 13217 amendment.** The four-item list of "compile-time meta API patterns":
   - REMOVE `bun.eval(...)` calls
   - Final three-item list: `reflect` / `emit` / `emit.raw`
2. **SPEC §30 retirement.** §30.1 (compiler-internal scope) MAY be preserved as a note that `bun.eval()` is an internal compiler implementation surface; §30.2 (`bun.eval()` inside `${}` markup interpolations) is RETIRED — the entire subsection deletes. §30.3 (security) deletes (no longer a user-facing surface to secure).
3. **SPEC §7.2 ${} extension list.** Remove the `bun.eval()` enumeration entry (the broken cross-ref to §29 also drops with it; F-009 closes mechanically).
4. **SPEC §22.12 amendment.** Add an explicit clause confirming Approach C extends to `${}` interpolation — eliminate any future ambiguity. Suggested clause: *"Approach C extends transitively to `${}` markup interpolation. JS-host ambient globals (`bun`, `process`, `setInterval`, `fetch`, etc.) and arbitrary JS-host-eval surfaces (`bun.eval`, etc.) are NOT permitted in `${}` either; the meta surface for `${}` is the same enumerated primitive set as `^{}`."*
5. **E-EVAL-001 error code.** Currently fires when `bun.eval()` throws at compile time. Under (a), `bun.eval()` itself fires `E-META-001` at user-write-site. E-EVAL-001 may persist as compiler-internal-only (no user-facing fire path) OR retire. **Open sub-question for HU-2:** what's E-EVAL-001's residual disposition?
6. **Compiler-managed alternative for the "year" example.** §30.2's worked example `<footer>© ${ bun.eval("new Date().getFullYear()") }</footer>` needs a non-`bun.eval` canonical form. Options for the new canonical form (open for HU-2):
   - (a) `${ meta.compileTimeYear() }` — new compile-time meta primitive (extends META_BUILTINS to 13; minor)
   - (b) A stdlib helper `import { currentYear } from "scrml:time"; ... ${ currentYear() }` — runtime, not compile-time (the year renders fresh per page load)
   - (c) Hardcoded literal — the user types the year. Lowest-tech.
7. **Cascade closures (mechanical, not separately discussed):**
   - F-002 (1a) — §22.4 list shrinks per migration #1
   - F-010 (1a) — §7.2 list shrinks per migration #3

### Findings closed by HU-1

- **F-003 (1a, LOAD-BEARING, GENUINE DESIGN QUESTION)** — RATIFIED (a) subsume. Approach C extends to `${}`. `bun.eval()` user surface retires.
- **F-002 (1a, LOAD-BEARING)** — mechanical cascade — §22.4 list amendment per F-003 disposition.
- **F-010 (1a, MEDIUM)** — mechanical cascade — §7.2 list amendment per F-003 disposition.
- **F-009 (1a, LOW)** — mechanical cascade — §7.2 broken cross-ref §29→§30 fixes via §7.2 list amendment (the `bun.eval()` entry that carried the broken cross-ref is removed).

### Findings advanced (implicit-confirmed, awaiting HU-2 mechanical finalization)

- **F-001 (1a, LB) / F-009 (1b, LB)** — V-kill direction at SPEC §7.5 implicit-confirmed via Q1 (user accepted `<x>: string? = not` as canonical V-kill decl shape). HU-2 to formally ratify.
- **F-016 (1a, LB)** — V-kill direction at SPEC §52.4.1 server-authority sibling. Implicit-confirmed via Q1 + the cluster-A direction. HU-2 to formally ratify.
- **F-008 (1a, LB)** — V-kill ~30 worked example migration. Implicit-confirmed via Q1. HU-2 to formally ratify.

### Carry-forward open items from HU-1

- **§30.2's "year" example replacement form.** Sub-question 6 above. HU-2.
- **E-EVAL-001 residual.** Sub-question 5 above. HU-2.

### Banked methodology from HU-1

- **[[feedback_no_greek_chars_in_options]]** — PA SHALL NOT use Greek characters in option labels; user can't type them on their keyboard. Use ASCII `a` / `b` / `c` or short words.

## HU-2 candidate queue — next questions to surface

Ordered by directional-cleanliness (mechanical-confirmations first; SPEC-internal contradictions needing user-eyeballs second; genuine design questions third). PA will present these in the next chat exchange — not yet asked.

### Q3 (mechanical confirmation) — V-kill cluster direction final ratification

Closes F-001 (1a) + F-009 (1b) + F-008 (1a) + F-016 (1a). The direction is implicit-confirmed via HU-1 Q1 but not formally ratified. One "go" closes the whole V-kill cluster (cluster A in the heads-up agenda). Migration scope: SPEC §7.5 grammar production rewrite + §52.4.1 server-authority sibling rewrite + ~30 worked example mechanical migration across §4.12 / §5 / §6.5 / §6.6 / §6.7 / §13.5 / §15.10 / §22.5 / §40.7 / §51.x / §52 / §55 / §56.

### Q4 (mechanical confirmation) — PIPELINE.md `deriveEngineVarName` "Machine" suffix-strip

Closes F-021 (1b, LB). SPEC §51.0.C explicit table says `MarioMachine` → `marioMachine` (literal lowercase-first, suffix KEPT). PIPELINE.md line 822-830 algorithm strips the suffix (`MarioMachine` → `mario`). PRIMER B14 corroborates SPEC. Direction: PIPELINE catches up to SPEC. Confirm.

### Q5 (needs user eyeballs — SPEC-internal contradiction) — F-019 schema placement after v0.3

SPEC §39.2/§39.3 prose says "alongside, not inside" `<program>`. The §39.2 worked example shows `<schema>` INSIDE `<program db="...">`. §40.8 v0.3 ratification says "one-program-per-application; everything inside `<program>`." Three different positions in the same SPEC.

Question: post-v0.3, what does "top-level" mean for `<schema>` placement?
  - (a) Inside `<program>` as a direct child (matches §39.2 example + v0.3 ratification; §39.2/§39.3 prose updates to match)
  - (b) Outside `<program>` at file root (matches §39.2/§39.3 prose; §39.2 example updates + v0.3 needs a `<schema>` exception)

PA's read: (a) is consistent with v0.3 one-program-per-application; the prose drifted, not the example. But the audit takes no side until heads-up explicitly decides.

### Q6 (needs user eyeballs — SPEC-internal contradiction) — F-018 §55.5 validity surface synthesis trigger

PA hasn't surfaced the contradicting text yet; will read SPEC §55.5 + PIPELINE Stage 6.7 + PRIMER §8 before HU-2 starts and present the two contradicting positions in the next chat exchange.

### Q7 (mechanical confirmation, batched) — Kickstarter v2 staleness wave

5 LOAD-BEARING + 2 MED kickstarter drifts (1b F-001, F-002, F-013, F-022, F-020, F-003, F-007). All "kickstarter catches up to SPEC" mechanical. Batch one "go" closes them all. Migrations: channels file-level → channels inside `<program>` · `@debounced(N)` → `debounced=DURATION` attribute · `<x> pinned` → `<x pinned>` · `< db>` `protect=` → updated form · add "no async/await" standing rule · drop the `<*>` example shorthand · scattered rule= arrow form vs target form cleanup.

### Q8 (needs user direction) — PRIMER §6.2 quoted-text drift (F-014, LB)

Migration target is mechanically clear (bare prose → `"..."` display-text literal per S111). Already shown in HU-1 worst-offender 5 with the post-migration form. Confirm migration direction; no design ambiguity.

### Out-of-near-queue (revisit after the LB batch)

- F-004 (§3.1 Contexts table HOLE — missing `^{}` / `_{}` / `!{}`)
- F-011 (§4.15 structural-elements registry HOLE — consolidation question)
- F-005 / F-006 / F-007 / F-014 / F-015 / F-017 (Phase-1a structural cleanup batch — TOC + headings + renumber leftovers)
- Cluster C (validity surface, §55.5 + §6.11) — after Q6
- Cluster F (engine surface) — after Q4 lands
- PRIMER Pillar 5b (F-010, 1b) — SPEC catches up to canon; needs heads-up direction
