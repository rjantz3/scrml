# SPEC Consolidation — Heads-Up Resolutions (Phase 2)

This is the running log of per-finding resolution decisions for the SPEC consolidation effort. Each HU-N sub-session resolves one or more findings from the Phase 1a + Phase 1b audits. When a finding is closed here, Phase 3 (example coverage / SPEC amendment / canon migration) executes against the direction recorded.

**Conventions:**
- HU-N = heads-up sub-session N. Sequentially numbered.
- Each HU section records: questions discussed, decisions ratified (verbatim user direction where applicable), findings closed / advanced, carry-forward open items, and next-HU candidate questions.
- Option labels: ASCII letters `(a)` / `(b)` / `(c)` or short words — NEVER Greek (per [[feedback_no_greek_chars_in_options]] — user can't type them on their keyboard).
- Final resolution direction is reproduced here verbatim so Phase 3 work has a single source of truth. The audit docs are the EVIDENCE chain; this doc is the DECISIONS chain.

## HU-1 — 2026-05-25 — Mental-model anchors + F-003 ratification

### Questions discussed

**Q1 (user):** *"is `: string? ` syntactic suguar for `: not -> string` ?"*

**Q2 (user):** *"`^{}` Im not sure if I have gone back and forth on this or if I was along for the ride (my fault). the way I see it (now at least) is that the up arrow is like saying 'go over his head'. does that make sense?"*

### Q1 resolution — `string?` is sugar for `string | not` (union, not arrow)

**SPEC §7.5 line 5573 is authoritative:** *"`T?` sugar. Postfix `?` is syntactic sugar for `T | not`. The compiler desugars before type checking."*

In code:
```scrml
<selected>: string? = not
// desugars to
<selected>: string | not = not
```

The `not -> string` phrasing in Q1 was an informal sketch; `->` in scrml is the function return-type arrow (`function f() -> string { ... }`), not a union connector. PA confirmed the union reading; user's mental model is anchored.

**Implicit ratification carried by Q1:** the migration target for the V-kill cluster (F-001 / F-008 / F-009 / F-016) uses `<x>: string? = not` syntax — user did not contest the migration shape, only the desugaring semantics. The V-kill direction (amend §7.5 grammar production + ~30 worked examples + §52.4.1 sibling to V5-strict structural form) is implicit-confirmed for HU-2 finalization but not yet executed.

### Q2 resolution — `^{}` mental model anchored to S114 Approach C

**The user's mental model:** *"the up arrow is like saying 'go over his head'"*. PA confirmed this matches Approach C (S114) when read as **"go over the runtime's head"** — `^{}` is the compile-time context. Code inside runs DURING COMPILATION, not at app-runtime. The compiler reads it, evaluates it, and inlines the result.

**NOT "over the language's head"** — Approach C explicitly closed the JS-host escape path (pre-S114 proposals that permitted `await import(...)`, `bun.eval()`, host ambient globals). Per SPEC §22.12: *"The general-developer `^{}` body parser SHALL accept only scrml-native + this enumerated primitive set; JS-host ambient globals (`bun`, `process`, `setInterval`, `fetch`, etc.) are NOT in the META_BUILTINS set and trigger E-META-001."*

What's IN (S114 closed set):
```scrml
^{
    const fields = reflect(User).fields           // compile-time introspection
    emit(`<input name="${field.name}"/>`)         // compile-time markup gen
    const userType = reflect(User)                // scrml-native + 3 compile-time primitives
}
```

What's OUT:
```scrml
^{
    const config = await import("./config.js")    // E-AWAIT-NOT-IN-SCRML
    const year = bun.eval("Date.now()")           // E-META-001
    const data = await fetch(url)                 // E-META-001
}
```

### F-003 RATIFICATION — disposition (a) "subsume" — Approach C subsumes §30.2

**User ratification (verbatim, HU-1):** *"a"* (with note: user keyboard can't type Greek characters; PA banked the rule [[feedback_no_greek_chars_in_options]] going forward).

**Decision:** Approach C extends transitively to `${}` markup interpolation. `bun.eval()` retires as a user-facing surface entirely. The "over the runtime's head" reading from Q2 applied uniformly: `bun.eval()` is JS-host runtime escape, not compile-time meta — doesn't belong in EITHER `^{}` body OR `${}` interpolation.

**Concrete mechanical migrations this ratification triggers:**

1. **SPEC §22.4 line 13217 amendment.** The four-item list of "compile-time meta API patterns":
   - REMOVE `bun.eval(...)` calls
   - Final three-item list: `reflect` / `emit` / `emit.raw`
2. **SPEC §30 retirement.** §30.1 (compiler-internal scope) MAY be preserved as a note that `bun.eval()` is an internal compiler implementation surface; §30.2 (`bun.eval()` inside `${}` markup interpolations) is RETIRED — the entire subsection deletes. §30.3 (security) deletes (no longer a user-facing surface to secure).
3. **SPEC §7.2 ${} extension list.** Remove the `bun.eval()` enumeration entry (the broken cross-ref to §29 also drops with it; F-009 closes mechanically).
4. **SPEC §22.12 amendment.** Add an explicit clause confirming Approach C extends to `${}` interpolation — eliminate any future ambiguity. Suggested clause: *"Approach C extends transitively to `${}` markup interpolation. JS-host ambient globals (`bun`, `process`, `setInterval`, `fetch`, etc.) and arbitrary JS-host-eval surfaces (`bun.eval`, etc.) are NOT permitted in `${}` either; the meta surface for `${}` is the same enumerated primitive set as `^{}`."*
5. **E-EVAL-001 error code.** Currently fires when `bun.eval()` throws at compile time. Under (a), `bun.eval()` itself fires `E-META-001` at user-write-site. E-EVAL-001 may persist as compiler-internal-only (no user-facing fire path) OR retire. **Open sub-question for HU-2:** what's E-EVAL-001's residual disposition?
6. **Compiler-managed alternative for the "year" example.** §30.2's worked example `<footer>© ${ bun.eval("new Date().getFullYear()") }</footer>` needs a non-`bun.eval` canonical form. Options for the new canonical form (open for HU-2):
   - (a) `${ meta.compileTimeYear() }` — new compile-time meta primitive (extends META_BUILTINS to 13; minor)
   - (b) A stdlib helper `import { currentYear } from "scrml:time"; ... ${ currentYear() }` — runtime, not compile-time (the year renders fresh per page load)
   - (c) Hardcoded literal — the user types the year. Lowest-tech.
7. **Cascade closures (mechanical, not separately discussed):**
   - F-002 (1a) — §22.4 list shrinks per migration #1
   - F-010 (1a) — §7.2 list shrinks per migration #3

### Findings closed by HU-1

- **F-003 (1a, LOAD-BEARING, GENUINE DESIGN QUESTION)** — RATIFIED (a) subsume. Approach C extends to `${}`. `bun.eval()` user surface retires.
- **F-002 (1a, LOAD-BEARING)** — mechanical cascade — §22.4 list amendment per F-003 disposition.
- **F-010 (1a, MEDIUM)** — mechanical cascade — §7.2 list amendment per F-003 disposition.
- **F-009 (1a, LOW)** — mechanical cascade — §7.2 broken cross-ref §29→§30 fixes via §7.2 list amendment (the `bun.eval()` entry that carried the broken cross-ref is removed).

### Findings advanced (implicit-confirmed, awaiting HU-2 mechanical finalization)

- **F-001 (1a, LB) / F-009 (1b, LB)** — V-kill direction at SPEC §7.5 implicit-confirmed via Q1 (user accepted `<x>: string? = not` as canonical V-kill decl shape). HU-2 to formally ratify.
- **F-016 (1a, LB)** — V-kill direction at SPEC §52.4.1 server-authority sibling. Implicit-confirmed via Q1 + the cluster-A direction. HU-2 to formally ratify.
- **F-008 (1a, LB)** — V-kill ~30 worked example migration. Implicit-confirmed via Q1. HU-2 to formally ratify.

### Carry-forward open items from HU-1

- **§30.2's "year" example replacement form.** Sub-question 6 above. HU-2.
- **E-EVAL-001 residual.** Sub-question 5 above. HU-2.

### Banked methodology from HU-1

- **[[feedback_no_greek_chars_in_options]]** — PA SHALL NOT use Greek characters in option labels; user can't type them on their keyboard. Use ASCII `a` / `b` / `c` or short words.

## HU-2 — 2026-05-25 — Lifecycle annotation discovered + syntax disambiguated

### Context

During HU-2 (incremental), user clarified that their earlier `not -> string` sketch (which PA initially read in HU-1 as an informal union) was invoking the existing **`(A -> B)` lifecycle annotation** at SPEC §14.3 line 7107. User couldn't recall the exact syntax (forgot parens). PA grep'd the archive and surfaced:

- SPEC §14.3 line 7099 + 7107 — current SPEC ratifies `(A -> B)` lifecycle annotation; post-S89 already uses `not` (`passwordHash: (not -> string)`); E-TYPE-001 fires on access-before-transition.
- 3 deep-dives from 2026-04-08 (state-dynamics-design / debate-state-dynamics / contracts-mutable-data).
- Article draft `scrml-support/voice/articles/mutability-contracts-draft-2026-04-29.md` — frames lifecycle annotation as flagship feature in 11 places.
- state-dynamics-design DD `status: active` since 2026-04-08 — open extension question.

Two audit holes surfaced:
- **F-023 (NEW from HU-2)** — PRIMER + kickstarter v2 carry ZERO mentions of lifecycle annotation despite SPEC §14.3 ratifying it.
- **F-024 (NEW from HU-2)** — Syntax-overload of `->` token: serves both static return-type annotation (`function f() -> string`) AND temporal lifecycle annotation (`(not -> string)`). Semantically disjoint uses; same glyph.

### User-voice anchor (verbatim)

> *"yes a. this was part of the basis. when I first envistioned the scrml type-system, this was my first real novel (at least to me (truck driver(no knowledge of specific prior art))) idea for scrmls type system"*

Lifecycle annotation is FOUNDATIONAL to scrml's type-system identity; predates V5-strict, V-kill, engines-as-Tier-2. Catch-up scope for F-023 is FLAGSHIP-section, not footnote.

> *"I dont care so much about what syntax we use, I dont want to crowd -> if it is fundamentally something else."*

Syntax-overload concern legitimate. Return-type and lifecycle are static-vs-temporal — fundamentally different concepts. `->` keeps return-type (Rust/OCaml/Haskell/Python prior-art alignment); lifecycle gets a temporally-flavored token.

### F-024 ratification — `to` (CONTEXTUAL keyword) for lifecycle annotation

**User-voice trail (verbatim, HU-2 sub-thread):**

> *"confirm then is unused, lock it"*

[PA grep'd `then` — unused as scrml keyword. Initial lock landed.]

> *"is "to" a kw?"*

[PA grep'd `to` — NOT a scrml keyword at lex level; heavy use as `<onTransition to=>` / `<onTimeout to=>` / `<onIdle to=>` ATTRIBUTE name (semantic-consistent with lifecycle "transition to" reading); one existing sample uses `to` as parameter name: `samples/gauntlet-r14/rust-state-machine.scrml:26` — `function isValid(from, to) { ... }`.]

> *"swap to to, but here's the thing If this compiler can infer everything that it does there should be no issue with to usage later ( or very minimal, and mitigabel )"*

**FINAL LOCK: lifecycle annotation syntax is `(A to B)` with CONTEXTUAL-KEYWORD semantics for `to`.**

`to` is recognized as `KwTo` only in the lifecycle-annotation type-expression context (`( A to B )` inside a type position — primarily struct-field type annotations per current SPEC §14.3, and any future contexts the heads-up extends lifecycle annotations to per the state-dynamics-design DD carry-forward). In every other context — function-parameter lists, local-variable declarations, expression position, property access — `to` parses as an ordinary identifier.

**No existing sample needs migration.** The `samples/gauntlet-r14/rust-state-machine.scrml` `function isValid(from, to) { ... }` parameter-name use stays valid: `to` in a function-parameter list is NOT in lifecycle-annotation type-expr position, so contextual recognition doesn't fire.

**Precedent for contextual-keyword semantics:** scrml ALREADY does this with `from` — `from` is a keyword in `import { x } from "..."` position and an identifier elsewhere. The composed-engines architecture (S98 + S111 charter B) treats lexer-mode and grammar-context as first-class design tools; adding `to` as a contextual keyword extends an established pattern without new mechanism.

**User's mitigation framing (verbatim above):** the compiler's contextual-inference IS the mitigation. Future adopter use of `to` as identifier (variable / param / property) is unaffected outside lifecycle-annotation type-expr position. Edge cases (an adopter writes a lifecycle-annotation-shaped expression containing a `to` identifier inside the type — improbable shape) can be diagnosed via a `W-IDENT-CONTEXTUAL-KEYWORD` info-lint when the parser observes ambiguity — informational, not error.

**Reserving discipline:** `to` is contextually-reserved at the scrml-source level FOR THE LIFECYCLE-ANNOTATION TYPE-EXPR CONTEXT ONLY. Future SPEC amendments SHALL NOT introduce additional context-positions that recognize `to` as a keyword without explicit heads-up ratification — the contextual-keyword surface stays narrow.

### Migration scope (concrete; mechanical)

**SPEC.md sites (Phase 2 amendment):**
- §14.3 line 7099 — `passwordHash: (not -> string),` → `passwordHash: (not to string),`
- §14.3 line 7107 — normative statement `(A -> B) — lifecycle annotation` → `(A to B) — lifecycle annotation`. Update the prose accordingly.
- Any other `(A -> B)` in SPEC body referencing lifecycle — PA to grep + sweep during the Phase-2 SPEC amendment work.

**Mutability-contracts article draft (status: draft, not shipped; revise before publication):**
- Line 125, 250, 252, 338, 361 — all `(A -> B)` / `(null -> ...)` / `(null -> T)` / `null -> number` references migrate to the `to` form.
- Note: line 338 still references `null -> string` (pre-S89). Two migrations in one sweep: `null` → `not` AND `->` → `to`.

**PRIMER + kickstarter (F-023 catch-up):** new flagship sections use `(A to B)` from authoring outset.

**Phase 3 example coverage:** new sample / example files demonstrating lifecycle annotation use the `(A to B)` form from authoring outset. Existing samples that use `to` as a non-lifecycle identifier (e.g., `function isValid(from, to)`) stay as-is — contextual-keyword semantics handle the distinction.

**Native-parser implementation note (post-Phase-2):** when the lifecycle-annotation type-expr production is wired into the native parser, `to` recognition is gated on the parser's "in lifecycle-annotation type-expr" context-state; outside that context the lexer emits `Ident` for the `to` text. Same architectural pattern as the existing `from`-in-import handling. Bridge surface for the `->` legacy form remains available during the migration window (output the same lifecycle-annotation AST whether the source reads `(A -> B)` or `(A to B)`) until SPEC §14.3 amendment + corpus migration lands.

### Findings closed by HU-2 partial-batch (lifecycle thread)

- **F-024 (HU-2 NEW)** — RATIFIED. Lifecycle-annotation syntax disambiguates from return-type. Locked: `(A to B)`. `->` remains return-type-only.
- **F-023 (HU-2 NEW, was Q9 from HU-1 close)** — RATIFIED direction (a): PRIMER + kickstarter catch up to SPEC on lifecycle annotation. Flagship-section scope, not footnote. Uses post-F-024 syntax `(A to B)`.

## HU-2 (continued) — Q4 closure: E-EVAL-001 retires

### Question + user direction

Q4 (from HU-2 batch surface): E-EVAL-001 residual disposition under F-003 (a). PA's initial recommendation in the HU-2 batch was (a) keep-as-compiler-internal — based on speculation that E-EVAL-001 "covers" compiler-internal `bun.eval()` failures per §30.1.

**User (verbatim):**
> *"lets look at 4"*
> *"do the grep"*

### Grep-verified facts (Phase-0-equivalent verification)

PA grep'd `compiler/src/` for E-EVAL-001 fire sites:

- **Exactly ONE fire site:** `compiler/src/codegen/rewrite.ts:510-512`
- **Fire condition:** wraps user-written `${ bun.eval(...) }` throws per §30.2 recognition
- **Compiler-internal `bun.eval()` use (§30.1 — constant evaluation, type helpers, SQLite at compile time):** propagates as JS-exception through stage-boundary handlers; NOT via E-EVAL-001. E-EVAL-001 was never a compiler-internal code.

**Post-F-003 (a) — which retires §30.2 entirely — E-EVAL-001 has zero remaining fire paths.** The rewrite.ts:510-512 block becomes dead code.

**PA's initial (a) recommendation was wrong** — based on speculation, not grep. Banked methodology rule: [[feedback_grep_fire_sites_before_claiming_coverage]] (NEW from this exchange).

### Q4 RATIFICATION — disposition (b): retire E-EVAL-001 entirely

**Decision:**
- §34 line 15218: drop the E-EVAL-001 catalog row
- `compiler/src/codegen/rewrite.ts:510-512`: drop the `recordError(... "E-EVAL-001" ...)` block (dead code post-F-003 (a))
- Any test files asserting on E-EVAL-001 fire: drop or migrate
- No replacement error code; compiler-internal `bun.eval()` failures continue propagating via existing JS-exception → stage-boundary handler machinery (no dedicated code needed)

### §34 sibling-cascade audit (concurrent verification per Q4 grep)

User asked for cascade check before closing Q4: are there OTHER §34 codes that die when F-003 (a) lands?

**Answer: only E-EVAL-001 dies.** PA grep'd §34 for §30-referencing rows + bun.eval-mentioning rows + §22.4 + dead-fire-site candidates:

- **E-META-EVAL-001 (§22.4)** — NOT dead. Fires at `compiler/src/meta-eval.ts:447` when `^{}` body evaluation throws. Approach C keeps `^{}` body parsing scrml-native + 3 compile-time primitives (reflect / emit / emit.raw); those CAN throw, this code stays alive.
- **E-META-EVAL-002 (§22.4)** — NOT dead. Same locus; fires when `emit`/`emit.raw` produces code that re-parses unsuccessfully. Stays alive.
- **E-EVAL-001 (§30.2)** — DEAD per above.

No hidden siblings. The §34 cascade is exactly one row.

### F-003 (a) source-cascade scope (NEW surfaced during Q4 grep — for Phase 2 amendment work)

Beyond the §34 catalog row, F-003 (a) requires compiler-source cleanup at 8 sites. Mechanical sed-style; surfacing scope here so Phase 2 amendment work captures it cleanly:

| File:Line | Change |
|---|---|
| `compiler/src/codegen/rewrite.ts:488-512` | Retire the entire `Evaluate bun.eval("...") calls at compile time` function (DEAD post-F-003 (a)) |
| `compiler/src/meta-checker.ts:15` | Doc-comment: drop `bun.eval` from `(reflect, bun.eval, emit) execute at compile time` |
| `compiler/src/meta-checker.ts:179` | Remove the `\bbun\s*\.\s*eval\s*\(` regex from the compile-time-API recognizer |
| `compiler/src/meta-checker.ts:1622` | Error message: drop `bun.eval` from `compile-time APIs (reflect, emit, bun.eval)` list |
| `compiler/src/meta-checker.ts:1656` | Same family error message |
| `compiler/src/codegen/constant-folder.ts:13` | Doc-comment phrasing update |
| `compiler/src/codegen/collect.ts:446` | Drop bun.eval from compile-time-only escapes list |
| `compiler/src/tokenizer.ts:719` | Update comment reference |
| `compiler/src/codegen/emit-html.ts:1693` | Remove `!inlined.includes("bun.eval")` filter (the filter has nothing to filter once bun.eval recognition retires) |
| `compiler/src/codegen/emit-html.ts:1707, 1712` | Comment block update |

### Findings closed by Q4

- **Q4 / F-003-cascade E-EVAL-001** — RATIFIED (b) retire. §34 row drops; rewrite.ts:510-512 fire site retires; no replacement code.

### Banked methodology from Q4

- **[[feedback_grep_fire_sites_before_claiming_coverage]]** — when PA's option-list claims "X covers Y" or "X fires on Z," PA MUST grep actual fire sites first. Don't speculate about coverage from spec text or memory. 5-minute grep cost; days-of-rework cost when an option-list ratifies a wrong reading. Sibling to [[feedback_bidirectional_hole_detection]] from same session — both are "verify before reasoning about behavior" rules.

---

### Open from HU-2 lifecycle thread (carry to HU-3)

- **state-dynamics-design DD extension question** (DD at `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/state-dynamics-design-2026-04-08.md` — `status: active` since 2026-04-08). The DD asks "should `(A to B)` lifecycle annotations extend beyond struct fields to enum-state-cells, or do engines/Tier-2 subsume that use case?" Lifecycle annotation is foundational; the extension question is "did we accidentally narrow scrml's type-system in ratification?" PA recommends: read the DD in full + the debate sibling DD before HU-3 ratifies.

### Banked S129 methodology rule (NEW from this exchange)

**Bidirectional hole-detection in canon-anchored audits.** Phase 1b's hole-detection only fired on "canon claims X / SPEC silent on X" — it missed the inverse "SPEC ratifies X / canon silent on X." Both directions are signal. Future audit dispatches must include both checks. F-023 was the precedent that surfaced this: SPEC §14.3 ratifies lifecycle annotation as a load-bearing feature; PRIMER + kickstarter never mention it; Phase 1b's audit missed the gap entirely. (Memory to be banked separately if not already covered by [[feedback_triage_genuine_needs_spec_crosscheck]] — that's a sibling but distinct rule.)

## HU-3 candidate queue — next questions to surface

Ordered by directional-cleanliness (mechanical-confirmations first; SPEC-internal contradictions needing user-eyeballs second; genuine design questions third). PA will present these in the next chat exchange — not yet asked.

### Q3 (mechanical confirmation) — V-kill cluster direction final ratification

Closes F-001 (1a) + F-009 (1b) + F-008 (1a) + F-016 (1a). The direction is implicit-confirmed via HU-1 Q1 but not formally ratified. One "go" closes the whole V-kill cluster (cluster A in the heads-up agenda). Migration scope: SPEC §7.5 grammar production rewrite + §52.4.1 server-authority sibling rewrite + ~30 worked example mechanical migration across §4.12 / §5 / §6.5 / §6.6 / §6.7 / §13.5 / §15.10 / §22.5 / §40.7 / §51.x / §52 / §55 / §56.

### Q4 (mechanical confirmation) — PIPELINE.md `deriveEngineVarName` "Machine" suffix-strip

Closes F-021 (1b, LB). SPEC §51.0.C explicit table says `MarioMachine` → `marioMachine` (literal lowercase-first, suffix KEPT). PIPELINE.md line 822-830 algorithm strips the suffix (`MarioMachine` → `mario`). PRIMER B14 corroborates SPEC. Direction: PIPELINE catches up to SPEC. Confirm.

### Q5 (needs user eyeballs — SPEC-internal contradiction) — F-019 schema placement after v0.3

SPEC §39.2/§39.3 prose says "alongside, not inside" `<program>`. The §39.2 worked example shows `<schema>` INSIDE `<program db="...">`. §40.8 v0.3 ratification says "one-program-per-application; everything inside `<program>`." Three different positions in the same SPEC.

Question: post-v0.3, what does "top-level" mean for `<schema>` placement?
  - (a) Inside `<program>` as a direct child (matches §39.2 example + v0.3 ratification; §39.2/§39.3 prose updates to match)
  - (b) Outside `<program>` at file root (matches §39.2/§39.3 prose; §39.2 example updates + v0.3 needs a `<schema>` exception)

PA's read: (a) is consistent with v0.3 one-program-per-application; the prose drifted, not the example. But the audit takes no side until heads-up explicitly decides.

### Q6 (needs user eyeballs — SPEC-internal contradiction) — F-018 §55.5 validity surface synthesis trigger

PA hasn't surfaced the contradicting text yet; will read SPEC §55.5 + PIPELINE Stage 6.7 + PRIMER §8 before HU-2 starts and present the two contradicting positions in the next chat exchange.

### Q7 (mechanical confirmation, batched) — Kickstarter v2 staleness wave

5 LOAD-BEARING + 2 MED kickstarter drifts (1b F-001, F-002, F-013, F-022, F-020, F-003, F-007). All "kickstarter catches up to SPEC" mechanical. Batch one "go" closes them all. Migrations: channels file-level → channels inside `<program>` · `@debounced(N)` → `debounced=DURATION` attribute · `<x> pinned` → `<x pinned>` · `< db>` `protect=` → updated form · add "no async/await" standing rule · drop the `<*>` example shorthand · scattered rule= arrow form vs target form cleanup.

### Q8 (needs user direction) — PRIMER §6.2 quoted-text drift (F-014, LB)

Migration target is mechanically clear (bare prose → `"..."` display-text literal per S111). Already shown in HU-1 worst-offender 5 with the post-migration form. Confirm migration direction; no design ambiguity.

### Out-of-near-queue (revisit after the LB batch)

- F-004 (§3.1 Contexts table HOLE — missing `^{}` / `_{}` / `!{}`)
- F-011 (§4.15 structural-elements registry HOLE — consolidation question)
- F-005 / F-006 / F-007 / F-014 / F-015 / F-017 (Phase-1a structural cleanup batch — TOC + headings + renumber leftovers)
- Cluster C (validity surface, §55.5 + §6.11) — after Q6
- Cluster F (engine surface) — after Q4 lands
- PRIMER Pillar 5b (F-010, 1b) — SPEC catches up to canon; needs heads-up direction
