# Stage 0c.A — Function-overload deletion progress

Re-dispatch (no isolation). Working directly on scrmlTS main.

## Baseline (2026-05-06)
- HEAD: c8c8bb93a22b36d05099dd0d0fcd0b4acc80ae55
- Working tree: clean
- Test counts: 8933 pass / 44 skip / 1 todo / 0 fail / 31612 expect calls / 8978 across 440 files
- Note: dispatch said expected baseline ~8209; actual is 8933. Expected post-deletion: ~8928 (drop of 5).

## Timeline

- 2026-05-06 baseline captured. Audit §8 read; scope confirmed (13 src sites + 5+ tests + README).
- Survey: all line numbers within 1-2 of audit citations. emit-client.ts call site verified at 545-547 (audit said 545-547). All other sites match.
- workspace-l2.test.js decision: line 11 mention "the workspace-aware overloads of analyzeText / buildDefinitionLocation" refers to TypeScript function-overload signatures (multiple call signatures of TS functions), NOT the SCRML state-type overload feature. INCIDENTAL — leave untouched.
- Chunk 1 committed (9d4c68f): emit-overloads.ts deleted; emit-client.ts/analyze.ts/reactive-deps.ts/codegen/README.md edited. Full test suite: 8933 pass / 0 fail (unchanged). Pre-commit hook: 8209 pass / 0 fail.
- Chunk 2 (combined w/ Chunk 4): type-system.ts surface (function/field/call site/export/comment) + unit tests (import + 5 tests at type-system.test.js:2349-2450) deleted together because they are interlocking — test file imports the deleted export. Full test suite: 8928 pass / 0 fail (drop of 5 = the deleted unit tests, as expected). Commit 82c6581.
- Chunk 3: ast-builder.js (tagFunctionsWithStateType + call site + comment) + ast.ts (stateTypeScope field on FunctionDeclNode). Verified zero remaining references via grep. Full test suite: 8928 pass / 0 fail (no count change).
