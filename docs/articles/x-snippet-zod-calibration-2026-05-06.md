title: X snippet — Zod-replacement claim calibration
date: 2026-05-06
session: S65
status: DRAFT — for Bryan's approval before posting
context: debate-05 verdict ratified C-narrow (ship parseVariant, hold parseShape); npm-myth article amended in same session

# X snippet — paste-ready

Three variants below; Bryan picks one (or none).

## Variant 1 — short calibration (most concise)

> Calibration on the "scrml fully replaces Zod" claim:
>
> The form-validation layer — `<name req length(>=2)> = <input/>` plus auto-synth `@form.isValid` / `@form.errors` — IS stronger than Zod+rhf. That part stands.
>
> For boundary-parsing of arbitrary JSON: scrml ships `parseVariant` for sum types. Struct-boundary parsing is the server function — intentionally.
>
> "None of it. Ever." was overreach. Calibrated form: "for forms, Zod doesn't belong. For boundary-parsing, scrml has its own answer."

## Variant 2 — quote-reply pattern (if responding to a critic)

> Fair pushback. The honest cut:
>
> ✅ Form validation: scrml's auto-synth validity surface (`@form.isValid`, `@form.errors`, cross-field via `eq(@field)`) is what Zod needs react-hook-form to do. Stronger.
>
> ✅ Discriminated-union boundary parse: `parseVariant(json, EnumType)` ships, type-driven dispatch.
>
> ⚠️ Struct boundary parse: server function, intentionally. No `parseShape`.
>
> ⚠️ Vocabulary breadth (`startsWith`, `multipleOf`, etc.): `pattern(/^prefix/)` or `custom`. Some land later.
>
> "Ever" was rhetoric. The form layer claim survives every test.

## Variant 3 — long-form (if doing a follow-up post)

> Update on the "scrml fully replaces Zod" claim. Ran a 5-expert debate. The verdict came out narrower than I'd argued and I want to surface it.
>
> What survives: scrml's form-validation layer is genuinely stronger than Zod. `<name req length(>=2)> = <input/>` synthesizes `@form.isValid`, `@form.errors`, `@form.touched` — the form-DX layer Zod itself doesn't ship (Zod needs react-hook-form for that). Cross-field validation is just predicate args: `<confirm req eq(@signup.password)>`. One declaration where Zod+rhf is two libraries.
>
> What was overreach: "None of it. Ever." For tRPC-shape boundary parsing of arbitrary JSON into a typed enum, scrml's answer is now `parseVariant(json, EnumType)` — type-driven dispatch, the enum's own variant names as discriminator, returns typed value or fails with `::ParseError`. This was the gap. It's closing.
>
> What stays intentionally absent: `parseShape` for structs. The server function IS the typed boundary. §53 boundary refinement fires predicates on assignment to typed parameters. Adding `parseShape` would be a synonym for what already happens. Holding the line on stdlib surface.
>
> Form layer: scrml wins. Boundary parse for sum types: scrml's answer is shipping. Boundary parse for struct shapes: server function, intentionally. Vocabulary breadth Zod has and scrml doesn't (`startsWith`, `multipleOf`, full schema transforms): `pattern`, `custom`, derived cells today; some land later.
>
> Calibrated claim: "for forms, Zod doesn't belong in a scrml app. For boundary-parsing, scrml has its own typed answer."

## Notes for Bryan

- **Variant 1** = standalone calibration post; ~60 words. Best if no critic has surfaced yet.
- **Variant 2** = quote-reply pattern; symbol-augmented for scannability. Best if responding to a "but what about X?" reply.
- **Variant 3** = full follow-up post (~180 words). Highest signal, most credibility-positive — surfaces the debate-and-revise process explicitly. Recommended IF you're comfortable showing the iteration in public.

**PA lean: Variant 3.** Demonstrating "I ran the debate, the panel narrowed my position, here's the calibrated form" is the strongest possible move for credibility on a contested technical claim. Anti-sycophancy convener stance made visible. The npm-myth article amendment (already landed) cross-references the same calibration.

If Variant 1 or 2 selected, no further article work needed — the npm-myth amendment already shipped. If Variant 3 selected, consider whether to also ship a follow-up dev.to article narrating the debate-and-revise (`scrml-debate-amends-zod-claim-devto-2026-05-06.md`). Out of scope for this session.
