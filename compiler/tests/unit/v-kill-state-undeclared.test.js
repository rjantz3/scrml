/**
 * V-kill (S123) — kill auto-state-cell synthesis from bare `@x = expr` writes.
 *
 * Per the auto-state-cell-synthesis deep-dive (2026-05-23 §6 verdict B), the
 * compiler pre-S123 silently synthesised a phantom state cell from every bare
 * `@name = expr` write in a fn / function / `${...}` body. SPEC §6.1.1 +
 * §6.1.3 + §6.2 require declarations via the structural form `<name>`; the
 * canonical form `@name` is read/write-only over a pre-declared cell. The
 * auto-synth path corrupted SYM PASS 1's cell-table (silent clobber on
 * `<x> = init` + later `@x = ...`) and admitted undeclared writes as legal.
 *
 * V-kill carve-out (deep-dive §6 + Approach-B follow-up): default-logic
 * auto-lift at `<program>` / `<page>` / `<channel>` body-top (`_synthetic`
 * marker present) STAYS legacy state-decl without the marker (Unit CC's
 * Option-2 enforcement territory). Meta `^{...}` body (blockContext "meta")
 * also stays legacy state-decl (BUG-META-6 dependency in dependency-graph.ts
 * + meta-checker.ts treats synth state-decl-in-meta as runtime @-writes;
 * changing the shape would ripple through DG/meta-eval/meta-checker).
 *
 * Implementation:
 *   - ast-builder.js (Simple reactive @x=expr branch): tags fn/function/${}
 *     body emissions with `_isReactiveAssign: true`. NOT tagged inside meta
 *     bodies (blockContext === "meta") or BS-synthesised default-logic lifts
 *     (parentBlock._synthetic === true).
 *   - symbol-table.ts PASS 1: skips registration for tagged state-decls
 *     (no phantom cell synth, no silent clobber).
 *   - symbol-table.ts PASS 3 walkResolveAtNames: fires E-STATE-UNDECLARED
 *     on tagged state-decls whose `name` does not resolve to a structural
 *     decl (or import binding) in scope.
 *
 * READ-side diagnostic deferred (V-kill §8 follow-up): firing
 * E-STATE-UNDECLARED on bare `@name` reads with no structural decl in scope
 * would surface false-positives across the engine corpus (`@ui` markup ref
 * vs `< machine name=UI ...>` register-as-`UI` mismatch — pre-existing
 * SYM-side engine var-name normalization issue, out of V-kill scope). The
 * primary V-kill safety win is the write-side fire; read-side is a normative
 * extension landed in a follow-up unit after engine var-name canonicalisation.
 *
 * Coverage (per brief §3):
 *   1. bare-WRITE without structural decl in fn body → E-STATE-UNDECLARED
 *   2. write-of-existing-decl in fn body → CLEAN (legal reassignment)
 *   3. read-of-existing-decl in fn body → CLEAN
 *   4. write-of-existing-decl in `${...}` user-written body → CLEAN
 *   5. default-logic body-top `@x = expr` at <program> body → CLEAN (Unit CC's territory)
 *
 * NOTE on the originally-prescribed case "bare-READ in fn body → E-STATE-UNDECLARED":
 *   Defer to V-kill §8 follow-up. The write-side covers the primary auto-synth
 *   kill; the read-side requires SYM engine var-name canonicalisation first.
