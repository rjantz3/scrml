/**
 * @module codegen/binding-registry
 *
 * BindingRegistry — explicit typed contract between HTML gen (analysis) and JS gen (emission).
 *
 * Currently the coupling between generateHtml() and generateClientJs() is
 * implicit: index.js creates two mutable arrays, passes them to generateHtml()
 * which populates them as a side effect, then passes the populated arrays to
 * generateClientJs(). This is the "implicit coupling" anti-pattern.
 *
 * BindingRegistry makes this contract explicit:
 * - Populated during HTML generation via addEventBinding() / addLogicBinding()
 * - Read-only during client JS emission via .eventBindings / .logicBindings
 *
 * Event bindings: { placeholderId, eventName, handlerName, handlerArgs, handlerExpr? }
 *   Recorded when HTML gen encounters a call-ref attribute (onclick=handler())
 *   or an expr attribute on an event (onclick=${() => fn(arg)}).
 *   Used by client JS gen to wire event listeners.
 *
 * Logic bindings: { placeholderId, expr, reactiveRefs?, isConditionalDisplay?, varName?, condExpr?, refs? }
 *   Recorded when HTML gen encounters:
 *   - A logic node embedded in markup (reactive display placeholder)
 *   - A variable-ref attribute value for if= (conditional display — simple var)
 *   - An expr attribute value for if= (conditional display — boolean expression)
 *   Used by client JS gen to wire reactive updates and conditional visibility.
 *
 *   Phase 4 addition: reactiveRefs (Set<string> | undefined)
 *     Pre-annotated by emit-html.js using extractReactiveDeps from reactive-deps.js.
 *     Contains the set of reactive variable names (without @ prefix) that the
 *     expression depends on. String-literal-aware — @var inside quoted strings is
 *     NOT included. When present, emit-event-wiring.js reads from this set instead
 *     of regex-scanning the expr string. When absent, the wiring falls back to regex.
 *
 *   If= expression support:
 *     condExpr (string | undefined) — raw expression string from if="..." or if=!@var
 *     refs (string[] | undefined)   — reactive variable names extracted from condExpr
 *     When condExpr + refs are present, emit-event-wiring subscribes to all refs and
 *     evaluates the compiled expression (with @var → _scrml_reactive_get("var")).
 *     When only varName is present, uses simple single-var display toggle (backward compat).
 *
 *   Phase 2g addition: if-chain branches and else
 *     Chain bindings carry a discriminator `kind`:
 *       - "if-chain-branch" — a positive branch (if= or else-if=)
 *       - "if-chain-else"   — the else branch
 *     Plus chain-shared fields: chainId, branchId, branchIndex (positive branches only),
 *     branchMode ("mount" | "display"), templateId? + markerId? (mount mode), and
 *     condition?/refs? (positive branches; condition.raw or condition.name yields
 *     the chain controller's per-branch test).
 *     placeholderId/expr are NOT used by chain bindings — they remain optional on
 *     the LogicBinding interface for backward compat with existing pre-Phase-2g bindings.
