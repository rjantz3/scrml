/**
 * Symbol Table — Stage 3.06 of the scrml compiler pipeline (SYM).
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B1 — V5-strict symbol-table extension. This module
 * constructs a per-scope state-cell registry over the FileAST produced by
 * TAB and decorated by NR. It is FOUNDATIONAL infrastructure that
 * subsequent A1b steps (B2 onward) build on:
 *
 *   B2 — V5-strict bare-name resolution + E-NAME-COLLIDES-STATE  [LANDED]
 *   B3 — `@name` resolution → record back-pointer on each ExprNode  [LANDED]
 *   B4 — Import binding registration + source-position `pinned` forward-ref
 *        check (E-STATE-PINNED-FORWARD-REF) + best-effort
 *        E-IMPORT-PINNED-INVALID  [LANDED]
 *   B5 — Cell classifier (bindable, markup-typed, derived-with-validators)  [LANDED]
 *   B6 — Render-by-tag E-CELL-NO-RENDER-SPEC + E-CELL-RENDER-SPEC-NOT-BINDABLE
 *   B7 — Derived-cell dep DAG + E-DERIVED-CIRCULAR-DEP
 *   B8 — L21 walker (E-DERIVED-VALUE-MUTATE + E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE)
 *   B11/B12 — Validity-surface synthesized cells (re-entrancy invariant)
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B2 — V5-strict bare-name resolution. The walker now also
 * visits `let-decl`, `const-decl`, `tilde-decl`, and `lin-decl` nodes (the
 * four local declaration kinds). For each local-decl, looks up the decl's
 * name in the current scope (via `lookupStateCell`'s parent-chain walk). If
 * a registered state-cell record is found at any enclosing scope, fires
 * `E-NAME-COLLIDES-STATE` per SPEC §6.1.3 + §34. Local names cannot shadow
 * registered state-cell names — the V5-strict invariant.
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B5 — Cell classifier. PASS 4 walks every registered
 * `state-decl` (via the per-scope `stateCells` map populated in PASS 1) and
 * stamps a `_cellKind` discriminant + `_isBindable` boolean on the AST decl
 * node. Four kinds:
 *
 *   - `"plain"`        — Shape 1 mutable cell (`<count> = 0`) OR Shape 3
 *                        derived with non-markup RHS (`const <doubled> = @count * 2`).
 *   - `"bindable"`     — Shape 2 with `renderSpec.element.tag` in
 *                        {input, textarea, select} (canonical bindable set,
 *                        per `codegen/emit-html.ts` BIND_DIRECTIVE_TAGS).
 *   - `"markup-typed"` — Shape 3 derived with markup RHS (e.g.,
 *                        `const <badge> = <span>...</span>`) OR a non-bindable
 *                        Shape 2 markup-RHS (defensively classified; A1b/B6
 *                        may later reject as illegal Shape-2).
 *   - `"compound-parent"` — Variant C compound (`<formRes> { <name> = ""; ... }`).
 *                           Children classify recursively as standalone state-decls
 *                           in the compound's sub-scope.
 *
 * Per A1b plan §4.6 line 230, B5 RECORDS classification (annotates AST only);
 * B6 will FIRE `E-CELL-NO-RENDER-SPEC` + `E-CELL-RENDER-SPEC-NOT-BINDABLE`
 * based on the `_cellKind` annotation. B7 will filter to plain/markup-typed
 * + isConst when building the derived-cell dep DAG.
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B3 — `@name` resolution. PASS 3 walks every ExprNode payload
 * on every AST node and, for each `@`-prefixed `IdentExpr`, calls
 * `lookupStateCell(currentScope, name.slice(1))`. The result (a
 * `StateCellRecord` or `null`) is stamped onto the IdentExpr as a
 * non-enumerable `_resolvedStateCell` field. This is the annotated-AST
 * contract that B5+ (cell classifier), B7 (derived-cell dep DAG), B10
 * (validator typer cross-field args), and B22 (`reset(@cell)` keyword)
 * consume to know which cell each `@name` read points to without
 * re-resolving by string lookup. Per A1b plan §4.6 line 228, B3 RECORDS
 * resolution; the resolution-fail catch-all is "existing infra" — B3 stamps
 * `null` on failed lookups (no new error code). Compound nav (`@form.name`)
 * resolves the BASE cell only at B3; deeper path resolution defers to
 * `lookupQualifiedStateCell` consumers when leaf-level resolution is needed.
 *
 * What B1 lands:
 *   - A `Scope` data structure (per-file root, child scopes for function /
 *     engine / component / compound state-decl bodies) with a `stateCells`
 *     `Map<string, StateCellRecord>`.
 *   - A registration walker that visits every `state-decl` node (both
 *     `structuralForm:true` `<x> = init` and `structuralForm:false` legacy
 *     `@x = init`) and registers its name in the containing scope.
 *   - Variant C compound (§6.3) recursive registration: parent name in the
 *     enclosing scope; children registered in the parent's compound sub-scope
 *     under qualified-path keys (e.g., `signup.name`).
 *   - Annotated AST: each `state-decl` gains a `_record: StateCellRecord`
 *     back-pointer; each scope-introducing node gains a `_scope: Scope`
 *     back-pointer; FileAST gains a top-level `_scope: Scope`.
 *   - Public lookup API: `lookupStateCell` (parent-chain walk),
 *     `lookupQualifiedStateCell` (multi-segment paths), `getScopeForNode`
 *     (reverse lookup).
 *
 * What B1 + B2 do NOT do (handled by later B-steps):
 *   - Resolve `@name` reads. B3 walks ExprNode trees and records the
 *     resolution back-pointer.
 *   - Synthesize validity-surface cells (`@compound.isValid` etc.). B11/B12
 *     synthesize and add records to existing scopes via the `_scope`
 *     back-pointer (re-entrancy invariant per BRIEF §6).
 *   - Walk engine state-children or component bodies. Today's AST stores
 *     `engine-decl.rulesRaw: string` and `component-def.raw: string` (no
 *     walkable children), so engine + component scope construction defers
 *     to B14+/B17+. The `ScopeKind` enum reserves `"engine"` and
 *     `"component"` for those steps; B1's walker fills `"file"`,
 *     `"function"`, and `"compound"` only.
 *
 * Performance budget: <= 5 ms per file (single AST traversal + Map inserts).

// but instead of firing collision diagnostics, registers ALIAS RECORDS for
// bindings whose init expression resolves (transitively) to a path into a
// `const`-derived reactive cell.
//
// Per SPEC §6.6.18 + the S134 const-deep-freeze DD ratification: a
// `const <name>` cell is **value-immutable from the developer's perspective**;
// the current L21 walker (PASS 6) catches direct `@cell.foo = x` writes but
// MISSES writes through local aliases (`let local = @cell; local.foo = x`).
// This walker populates `Scope.localAliases` so PASS 6 can extend its
// receiver-path check to cover aliased mutation forms.
//
// Chain-break rules (per SPEC §6.6.18 "Forms NOT covered (legal)" and per
// the DD §5.1 / §6 implementation sketch):
//   - Spread (`[...@cell]` / `{...@cell}`) → NEW value; no alias record.
//   - Object literal field (`{ x: @cell }`) → NEW container; no record on `w`.
//     Note: `w.x` aliases `@cell` via the JS heap, but our static analysis
//     conservatively chain-breaks at the object literal — the property
//     write would target `w.x.foo`, not `w.foo`, and tracking through the
//     literal field IS technically possible but introduces aliasing of
//     a single property which we choose not to model in this pass.
//   - Array literal (`[@cell]`) → NEW container; same reasoning as object.
//   - Binary / unary / logical / conditional / call → NEW value; no record.
//   - Method-call return (e.g., `@cell.filter(x => x)`) → call shape; no record.
//
// Forward propagation (init shapes that DO produce an alias record):
//   - `{kind: "ident", name: "@<cell>"}` — direct alias of derived cell.
//   - `{kind: "member", object: <chain rooted at @cell>}` — path alias.
//   - `{kind: "index", object: <chain rooted at @cell>}` — indexed alias
//     (computed index produces a sentinel `[…]` in pathTail; static-index
//     could be statically resolved but per the brief we conservatively
//     treat all index accesses as opaque).
//   - `{kind: "ident", name: "<localName>"}` where `<localName>` is already
//     in `localAliases` (transitive — flattened to the original cell).
//
// Destructuring:
//   - `let { a, b } = @cell` (object destructure) — each `bindName` becomes
//     an alias with `pathTail = [..rhsTail, fieldName]`. JS-spec semantics:
//     the bound name references the same heap object as the property.
//   - `let { ...rest } = @cell` — rest is a NEW object (Object.assign-style
//     shallow copy in JS spec); treat as chain-break (matches `{...@cell}`
//     spread per spec).
//   - `let [first, second] = @cell` (array destructure) — each element becomes
//     an alias with `pathTail = [..rhsTail, "[…]"]` (computed-index sentinel).
//   - `let [...rest] = @cell` — rest collects remaining elements into a NEW
//     array (Array.from-style shallow copy); treat as chain-break.
//   - Renamed (`let { a: aliased } = @cell`) — uses `bindName` not `fieldName`
//     as the local key.
//   - Nested destructure patterns — recurse; each nested binding gets a
//     pathTail rooted at the same cell.
//
// Function/closure boundary (per the brief — conservative chain-break):
//   - When an alias is passed AS AN ARGUMENT to a function call, the call
//     site doesn't propagate alias status into the callee. Parameters are
//     treated as fresh locals (no alias record).
//   - Closures (arrow functions) that DIRECTLY reference `@cell.foo = y`
//     inside their body are caught by the existing L21 walker's PASS 6
//     descent. No alias-tracking change needed for that case.
//
// Pass ordering: runs AFTER PASS 1 (state-cell registration) so
// `lookupStateCell` resolves correctly. Runs BEFORE PASS 6 (L21 walker) so
// `localAliases` is populated when the walker consults it. Sister-pass
// placement after B2 collision walker is correct — both passes consume
// PASS 1's scope annotations, so they run back-to-back.

 *
 * **Read-position note (load-bearing).** IdentExpr `span` values are produced
 * by `expression-parser.ts → spanFromEstree(node, file, baseOffset)`. When an
 * ExprNode is parsed via `safeParseExprToNode` from inside an isolated
 * substring (function bodies / interpolation segments), `baseOffset` is 0 —
 * so the IdentExpr's `span.start` is the offset WITHIN the substring, not
 * within the whole source file. That makes IdentExpr spans unsuitable as
 * absolute read-positions for the source-position forward-ref check.
 *
 * The fallback is the **enclosing AST node's `span.start`** — passed in via
 * the walker as `readPos`. Every container that B3 traverses
 * (`function-decl`, `state-decl`, statement nodes, etc.) has an absolute
 * span set by ast-builder. That position is the lower bound of the read's
 * source-position; using it is conservative-correct:
 *
 *   - `function f() { return @x } ; <x pinned> = 0` — function.span.start
 *     (~14) < x.span.end (~66) → fires (correct).
 *   - `<x pinned> = 0 ; function f() { return @x }` — function.span.start
 *     (>x.span.end) → no fire (correct).
 *   - `<x pinned> = @x + 1` — state-decl.span.start (=decl.span.start)
 *     < decl.span.end → fires (self-init; correct per spec).
 *
 * The conservative aspect: a read at `function.start + 50` syntactically
 * AFTER a pinned decl that sits at `function.start + 100` would still see
 * the read-position as `function.start`. But that scenario can't occur:
 * pinned decls live at file/program scope and at compound scope, never
 * inside function bodies — function bodies don't open a state-cell decl
 * surface. So the read-position approximation is exact for the cases the
 * spec normatively addresses.

//          treats compound parents as "cell has no render-spec" (compound
//          parents structurally have `children[]`, mutually exclusive with
//          `renderSpec`). Error message tightens to mention the wrapping form
//          (`<formRes><field/></>`) and `${@formRes.field}` interpolation as
//          spec-canonical alternatives.
//
//   §3.2 — Component RHS render-specs (PascalCase tag in the decl's renderSpec,
//          e.g., `<x> = <MyComp/>`) are DEFERRED. SPEC line 1341 requires
//          component-prop-catalog inspection (B14/M18/M20 territory); B6 v1
//          accepts these silently rather than mis-firing. PascalCase USE-sites
//          (`<MyComponent/>` in markup) are also accepted — the lowercase-tag
//          predicate filters them out before lookup.
//
// **Use-site detection.** A render-by-tag use is:
//   1. `node.kind === "markup"`
//   2. `node.selfClosing === true`
//   3. `node.tag` starts with a lowercase letter (`/^[a-z]/`)
//   4. `lookupStateCell(fileScope, node.tag)` returns non-null
//
// Step 3 is the deferral filter (Phase 0 §3.2). Step 4 is the decisive filter
// — HTML built-ins (`<br/>`, `<input/>`, `<img/>`, ...) are also self-closed
// lowercase markup, but they don't resolve to a state cell, so the walker
// no-ops on them.
//
// **Scope handling.** B6 uses file-scope lookup (`lookupStateCell(fileScope,
// tag)`). Compound sub-scope cells are not addressable as bare `<childName/>`
// from outside the compound — they're addressed as `<parent><childName/></>`
// (the wrapping form, SPEC line 1882). File-scope lookup matches the spec's
// documented use-cases. A compound-internal sibling render-by-tag (rare; only
// possible inside a Shape 3 markup-typed RHS that contains a sibling tag) is
// a known scope-limitation noted in Phase 0 §2.4.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per SPEC §6.6.18 (lock L21), in-place mutation of a `const`-derived cell
// SHALL be rejected at compile time. Three forbidden form classes:
//
//   1. Array mutating method calls — `@derivedArr.push(x)`, etc. (9 methods
//      per §6.5.1: push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, reverse, sort, fill,
//      copyWithin).
//   2. Object property writes / compound-assignments / delete —
//      `@derivedObj.foo = x`, `@derivedObj.foo += 1`, `delete @derivedObj.foo`,
//      and the 14 compound forms (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=,
//      >>=, >>>=, ??=, ||=, &&=).
//   3. In-compound derived sub-cell — `@form.derivedField.method(...)` /
//      `@form.derivedField.foo = x` where `derivedField` is `const`-declared
//      inside a Variant C compound parent.
//
// AST shape paths (per `tests/integration/parse-mutation-shapes.test.js`):
//
//   - `reactive-array-mutation` (specialized lowering, single-segment receiver,
//     method ∈ ARRAY_MUTATIONS) → check via `target` string + `method`.
//   - `reactive-nested-assign` (specialized lowering, `=` only) → check via
//     `target` string + `path[]`.
//   - `bare-expr` containing one of:
//       - `assign` (compound assigns; computed-index assigns; multi-segment
//         receivers; plain `=` on chained members) → check via leaf-ident
//         walk on `target`.
//       - `call` with `callee.kind === "member"` and method name ∈
//         ARRAY_MUTATING_METHODS — covers compound-receiver chains
//         `@form.errors.push(x)`.
//       - `unary` with `op === "delete"` and `argument.kind ∈ {"member",
//         "index"}` → check via leaf-ident walk on `argument`.
//
// **NEXT-STEP HOOK (E-DERIVED-WRITE):** §6.6.18 normative requires this check
// to share a pass with §6.6.8 E-DERIVED-WRITE (reassignment form). When that
// rule is implemented, it should join this walker — `@derived = newval` is an
// `assign` ExprNode whose `target` is a bare ident (not a member chain), so
// the dispatch is a sibling discriminator, not a separate walk.
//
// **OUT OF B8 SCOPE (deferred):**
//   - E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE (§55.7) — depends on B11/B12's synth-cell registry
//     which doesn't exist yet. B11 will extend this walker.
//   - Markup-typed derived cells: per §6.6.18, the rule applies uniformly;
//     markup APIs today expose no mutators so the rule is non-firing in
//     practice but no special exemption is needed in the walker.

//
// Per SPEC §55.1 (universal-core vocabulary, L4) + §55.10 (4-level error
// message resolution chain, L12 Edge F). For every state-decl with
// validators, B10 looks up each validator against the
// `validator-catalog.ts` module's predicate signature catalog and verifies:
//
//   1. Predicate name is in the universal-core (14 predicates per §55.1).
//      Library-surface predicates (`email`/`url`/`numeric`/`integer` from
//      `scrml:data`) are NOT in the universal-core catalog; B10 silently
//      passes through unknown names — a future tightening will register
//      stdlib predicates and convert this to a strict reject.
//
//   2. Arity matches:
//      - bareword (args: null) → must be `arity: 0` or `"0+inline"` predicate
//      - call-form with 1 arg → leading slot must match required-shape
//      - call-form with 2 args → leading slot + trailing inline-message-override
//      - call-form with > 2 args → reject (no spec predicate takes more)
//
//   3. Per-positional-arg shape matches the catalog signature:
//      - `relational-predicate` slot ↔ RelationalPredicateNode (B9 sibling kind)
//      - `regex` slot ↔ ESTree-`Literal`-via-escape-hatch with raw=`/.../`
//                       OR a string literal (alternative-form acceptance)
//      - `numeric` slot ↔ NumLit ExprNode (or numeric-typed expression —
//                          for now any non-string literal accepted; deeper
//                          type-inference deferred)
//      - `comparable-with-cell` / `any-equatable-with-cell` slots ↔ any
//                          ExprNode (full cell-type compatibility deferred
//                          per audit §1.3 cost-control)
//      - `array-of-cell-type` slot ↔ ArrayLit ExprNode
//      - `inline-message-override` slot ↔ string literal (StringLit). Dynamic
//                          override (anything else) is fired as a separate
//                          diagnostic — though B13 ultimately owns the formal
//                          extraction + inline-override-record.
//
// Failures fire `E-TYPE-031` (the existing umbrella per §55.1 line 24295)
// with a per-violation descriptive message.
//
// **DEFERRED to follow-up steps:**
//   - Cell-type compatibility check (`pattern(re)` on a `number` cell): needs
//     type-system.ts type inference. Audit §1.3 budgets this for a later
//     tightening.
//   - B13 owns formal Level-1 inline-override extraction onto the validator
//     record + explicit dynamic-override rejection error code.
//   - Cycle detection (E-VALIDATOR-CIRCULAR-DEP) is Phase 3 of B10 and lives
//     in dependency-graph.ts (Stage 7) per audit §1.4.
//   - B3 cross-field `@cell` resolution is read by Phase 3 (cycle detection);
//     B10 Phase 2 (this walker) does shape checks only.
//
// **WHY HERE (not type-system.ts):** B10's check is symbol-table-shaped —
// iterates state-decls, reads decl.validators, dispatches per-arg. Doesn't
// need full type inference. Follows the B6/B8 walker pattern (PASS 5 / PASS 6).

// four synthesized properties registered into its compound scope:
//
//   `@compound.isValid`   — boolean rollup (true ↔ ALL fields pass validators).
//   `@compound.errors`    — object map { fieldName: [...errorTags] }.
//   `@compound.touched`   — object map { fieldName: bool }.
//   `@compound.submitted` — boolean (compound-level only per §55.7 line 24468).
//
// **Trigger predicate (per audit §1.1):** `_cellKind === "compound-parent"`.
// Synthesis is UNCONDITIONAL for compound parents — even no-validator compounds
// get the surface, with trivially-valid defaults per §55.5 line 24415-24418
// ("predictability over namespace savings"). Single-value Tier-1 cells (L11
// Edge A) DO NOT get the surface (compound parent check filters them naturally).
//
// **Canonical types per §55, NOT §6.11 stub (per audit §1.2):**
//   - compound `errors` is OBJECT MAP keyed by field name (NOT `string[]`).
//   - per-field `errors` (B12 future) is array of `ValidationError` enum tags
//     (NOT singular `error: string`).
//
// **Runtime-hook annotations per §55.7 line 24449-24461 (audit §1.5):**
//   - `isValid`, `errors` are pure reactive derivations → `runtimeHookKind: null`.
//   - `touched` has runtime trigger (bind:value/bind:checked change OR first
//     focus-out) → `runtimeHookKind: "touch"`.
//   - `submitted` has runtime trigger (form's submit handler) →
//     `runtimeHookKind: "submit"`.
//   - B11 RECORDS the hook requirement on each synth record. A1c codegen reads
//     the annotation and emits the actual hook plumbing.
//
// **Cross-field deps via predicate args:** B10 Phase 3 already emits
// `validator-reads` edges in the dep-graph. B11 emits NO new DG edges — the
// reactive wiring for compound rollup (`isValid` reading each field's
// `isValid`) is logically a consequence of the synth records' annotations and
// is materialized by A1c codegen via the existing `validator-reads` machinery.
//
// **`submitted` is COMPOUND-LEVEL ONLY** per §55.7 line 24468 (audit §1.6).
// B12 (per-field surface) MUST NOT register per-field `submitted`.
//
// **E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE** is fired by the EXTENDED PASS 6 walker (see below).
// PASS 8 only registers — diagnostic firing rides on the existing walker
// pattern (audit §1.3 wave-ordering correction).

// so `@signup.name.isValid` resolves naturally via the existing API.
//
// **Cross-field deps:** B10 Phase 3 already wires `validator-reads` edges in
// the dep-graph (via `forEachIdentInValidatorArg` walking `@signup.password`
// references in `eq(@signup.password)` validator args). B12 emits NO new DG
// edges — the cross-field reactive wiring is materialized by A1c codegen
// reading the synth-record annotations + the existing edge machinery
// (mirrors B11's stance per audit §1.5 + B11 spec §"NO new DG edges").
//
// **E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE per-field scope:** B11 fires E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE only
// at compound scope (`@signup.isValid = false`). B12 extends the same PASS 6
// walker to fire on per-field writes (`@signup.name.isValid = false`).
// Implementation: relax B11's `hit.path.length !== receiverPath.length`
// guard to ALSO accept the case where the prefix resolves to a compound +
// the next segment is a registered field (the synth-property is the leaf).
// `findDeepestRegisteredOnPrefix` walks longest→shortest (B8's helper); for
// `@signup.name.isValid` the deepest registered prefix is `["signup","name"]`
// (the field cell), and the leaf `isValid` is the synth-property name. The
// extension is depth-2 instead of depth-1.

// **Implementation strategy (audit §1.3):** B11 EXTENDED B8's PASS 6 walker
// with a fourth dispatch path keyed on synth property names. B12 RELAXES the
// compound-vs-field guard so per-field paths fire too — receiver discrimination
// is now (compound-parent → all 4 properties) | (compound-child → 3 properties
// excluding `submitted`). B8's walker structure was prepared for this join
// (per primer §13.7 B8 specifics).
//
// **Receiver-chain root resolution** mirrors B8 (audit §1.7 integration story):
// the assignment target is `@compound.[.field.]synthProp = ...`; the chain
// root resolves via the existing `findDeepestRegisteredOnPrefix` helper, which
// after B12's `lookupQualifiedStateCell` extension descends through ANY cell
// with a `_scope` (compound parent's `kind:"compound"` scope OR compound
// child's `kind:"field"` scope). Fire fires unconditionally — both B11 and
// B12 unconditionally register all synth records for every compound parent +
// every compound child (audit §1.1).

//      `isConst === true` AND non-empty validators fires the diagnostic.
//      Per audit §1.7 + §55.14 line 24692, the message recommends the
//      refinement-type alternative (`const <x>: number(>=0) = ...`).
//
//      Per audit §1.5: engine auto-declared variables are NOT `isConst`, so
//      they pass through silently — engine-cell validators are LEGAL but
//      typically REDUNDANT per §55.14. Engine-derived (`<engine derived=>`)
//      with validators is REJECTED per §55.14 line 24689 but requires
//      engine-decl annotations not yet present (B14 sequencing). The walker's
//      `state-decl` filter skips engine-decls; the engine-derived case is
//      deferred to a B13.5/B14 follow-up.
//
//   2. **Level-1 inline-override extraction** — for non-derived cells with
//      validators, walk each `ValidatorEntry` and extract the trailing
//      string-literal arg as `inlineOverride: string` on the entry, when the
//      catalog declares an `inline-message-override` slot for that predicate
//      and the runtime arg-list has the slot populated. When the trailing
//      slot is present but the arg is NOT a static string literal, fire
//      `E-VALIDATOR-INLINE-DYNAMIC` (per L12 Edge F static-string rule).
//
// **Walker type:** AST-driven structural recursion, mirrors PASS 5 / PASS 6 /
// PASS 7 / PASS 8. Runs FOR FREE on top of B5 (cellKind), B9 (ExprNode args),
// B10 (catalog) — no new infrastructure.

// PASS 10 (B14) — Engine cell registration + cross-file mount validation
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per Phase A1b Step B14 (audit §2 ten-point brief; SPEC §51.0.A-K, §21.8, §34):
//
// PASS 10.A — REGISTER ENGINE CELLS:
//   Walks every `engine-decl` AST node in the file. For each:
//     1. Compute the auto-declared variable name per §51.0.C — derived from
//        the engine's `for=Type` (lowercase-first-character of the type name)
//        UNLESS `var=NAME` is present (override). Legacy `name=` is preserved
//        as a back-compat path.
//     2. Validate the chosen var name against existing same-scope state cells:
//        if a non-engine state-cell already exists with this name, fire
//        `E-ENGINE-VAR-DUPLICATE` (§51.0.C, §34) — the engine OWNS its
//        variable.
//     3. Register a `StateCellRecord` with `_cellKind: "engine"` + an
//        `engineMeta` annotation carrying §51.0.B-C surface data (varName,
//        forType, initialVariant (record only — B15 validates), pinned,
//        derivedExpr (record only — B16 consumes)).
//     4. Stamp the engine-decl AST node with `_record` + `_cellKind: "engine"`.
//
// PASS 10.B — CROSS-FILE ENGINE MOUNT VALIDATION (§51.0.D + §21.8 / M18):
//   Walks markup for self-closing tags whose tagName matches an import-
//   binding in the file scope. For each such tag, looks up the source
//   export's category via the MOD exportRegistry:
//     - If `category === "engine"`: legitimate cross-file mount; no record
//       registration required (the imported singleton is the cell).
//     - Else: fire `E-ENGINE-MOUNT-NOT-ENGINE` (added to §34 by this dispatch
//       — see audit §1.3) with the offending category and a remediation hint.
//
//   Engine awareness in MOD's exportRegistry is a precondition: today's
//   exportRegistry maps `kind: "const" | "type" | "function" | "channel"
//   | ...` and `category: "user-component" | "channel" | "type" |
//   "function" | "const" | "other"`. B14 extends MOD to recognize
//   `kind: "engine"` + `category: "engine"` for `export <engine ...>` Form 1
//   and for explicit `export const NAME = <engine ...>` Form 2. See
//   `module-resolver.js:buildExportRegistry`.
//
// PASS 10.C — E-COMPONENT-ENGINE-SCOPE (§51.0.K, deferred):
//   Today's AST stores component-def bodies as raw text (`component-def.raw:
//   string`); engine-decls inside component bodies are not present as
//   walkable children. B14 thus cannot reliably detect the violation in the
//   walker tree. The check is OWNED by B17 ("residual components-vs-engines
//   distinction") with a structural component-body parse precondition. The
//   audit §1.5 fire-site recommendation is acknowledged here; once
//   component bodies become walkable, the same B14 walker can fire it.

  // machine-typed cell `@x: N` (the §51.3.3 binding form — `@x: N` where
  // `<engine name=N>` governs it). In that case the machine-typed cell `@x` IS
  // the engine's governed variable; the engine MUST NOT auto-declare a SEPARATE
  // phantom cell (the prior `name=`-derived var, e.g. `modeMachine`). When the
  // engine governs `@x` but the phantom var diverges, the §51.0 engine emits a
  // POPULATED transition table keyed on the phantom while the §51.3 write-guard
  // for `@x` reads an EMPTY table — every legal transition throws E-ENGINE-001-RT
  // at runtime. Reconcile by binding the engine's variable to the user's cell.

  // the same `/<\s*[A-Z]/` heuristic type-system.ts:buildMachineRegistry uses).
  // The LEGACY arrow-body named machine (`<engine name=UserFlow for=Column> { .A => .B }`)
  // populates machineRegistry.rules and governs its cells via the §51.3 write-guard
  // (which already works) — its rulesRaw is `.A => .B`, NOT `<Variant>`, so this

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per Phase A1b Step B15 (audit §2 seven-point brief; SPEC §51.0.B/E/F/G,
// §34 catalog rows added by this dispatch):
//
// PASS 11 — VALIDATE ENGINE STATE-CHILDREN + RULE= + INITIAL=:
//   Walks every `engine-decl` AST node in the file. For each:
//
//     1. Populate `engineMeta.variants` from the file's typeRegistry (read
//        from `ast.typeDecls[]` — `parseEnumVariantsFromRaw` extracts
//        variant names). B14 left this empty; B15 populates here so
//        downstream consumers (B16, A1c) can read variants directly.
//
//     2. Validate `initial=` per §51.0.E. For NON-derived engines:
//          - absent → fire `W-ENGINE-INITIAL-MISSING` (lint; defaults to
//            first variant for codegen).
//          - present-but-not-a-valid-variant → fire
//            `E-ENGINE-INITIAL-INVALID-VARIANT`.
//        Derived engines (`derivedExpr !== null`) are SKIPPED — B16 owns
//        derived-specific rejections (E-DERIVED-ENGINE-NO-INITIAL).
//
//     3. Parse `engine-decl.rulesRaw` into state-children via
//        `parseEngineStateChildren` (engine-statechild-parser.ts). Skips
//        legacy `<machine>` arrow-rule bodies (the type-system handles
//        those via parseMachineRules).
//
//     4. Validate state-child exhaustiveness per §51.0.B + §51.0.F:
//          - For each variant of `engineMeta.variants`: confirm a state-
//            child with matching PascalCase tag exists. Missing → fire
//            `E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-MISSING`.
//          - For each state-child: confirm its tag is a variant. Unknown
//            → fire `E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-INVALID-VARIANT`.
//        Applied uniformly across non-derived AND derived engines (per
//        audit §1.3 — derived engines also list variants).
//
//     5. Validate `rule=` forms per §51.0.F three target-only forms:
//          - single-target / multi-target: every `.Variant` referenced
//            must be in `engineMeta.variants`. Mismatch → fire
//            `E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT`.
//          - wildcard `*`: legal; no fire.
//          - legacy event-arrow form (`event -> Variant`): fire
//            `E-ENGINE-RULE-LEGACY-SYNTAX`.
//          - parse-error: fire `E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT` (carries
//            the parser's diagnostic reason).
//
//     6. Records the parsed state-child entries onto
//        `engineMeta.stateChildren` for downstream B16 / B17 / A1c
//        consumption.
//
// **DEFERRED (per audit §1.4 + B15 brief #4 — body parser limitation):**
// Compile-time E-ENGINE-INVALID-TRANSITION for direct writes inside
// state-child bodies (`<Small>{@marioState = .Cape}` when `.Cape ∉
// .Small.rule`) requires the body to be walkable AST. Today the body is
// raw text. Once the parser elevates state-child bodies to walkable
// nodes, the same PASS 11 walker can dispatch on the engine variable's
// `_resolvedStateCell` annotation inside each body. See progress.md
// "DEFERRED ITEMS".
//
// Reusability: B15 READS B14's `engineMeta` to perform validation. B15
// does extend `engineMeta.variants` + `engineMeta.stateChildren` (the
// only annotations B15 owns); does NOT mutate B14's other fields.

 * For each variant, returns its declared payload field names IN ORDER (or
 * an empty array for unit variants). This is the minimum information PASS
 * 11 needs to validate payload bindings: arity matching uses count, unit-
 * variant rejection uses empty-vs-non-empty, reserved-name collision uses
 * field name list, named-form unknown-field uses field name set.
 *
 * Mirror of the variant-name parser above (`parseEnumVariantNamesFromRaw`)
 * but ALSO captures payload field names. The full type-system parser
 * (`parseEnumBody` in type-system.ts) parses field types too, but PASS 11
 * needs only the field NAMES — types matter for the named-form binding type
 * propagation, which is a §18.7 inheritance handled downstream by the
 * type-system pass, not B15.
 *
 * Returns `Map<variantName, fieldNames[]>`. Unit variants map to `[]`.

// B16: Derived-engine rejections (PASS 12) — A1b Phase
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per SPEC §51.0.J (Lock L20), a derived engine — declared via
// `<engine for=Type derived=expr>` — must reject three classes of authoring
// at compile time:
//
//   1. `initial=` attribute on the engine declaration —
//      `E-DERIVED-ENGINE-NO-INITIAL`. Initial value is computed from
//      `derived=expr` at engine-init time; an authored `initial=` is
//      meaningless and contradicts the derivation contract.
//
//   2. `rule=` attribute on a state-child — `E-DERIVED-ENGINE-NO-RULES`.
//      Transitions are determined by the source expression, not authored.
//      Today's parser (§51.0.B-J Move 14) does NOT yet expose state-children
//      with `rule=` attributes structurally; until then, B16 fires
//      NO-RULES whenever a derived engine's `rulesRaw` body contains any
//      transition rules (the line-shape `.From => .To` form). When the
//      parser learns Move 14, the same walker reads the structured
//      state-children directly.
//
//   3. Direct write to the engine's auto-declared variable (or `.advance(.X)`
//      method-call form per §51.0.G) — `E-DERIVED-ENGINE-NO-WRITE`. Derived
//      engine variables are read-only — the variable is the value of the
//      `derived=expr` reactively recomputed.
//
// Cycle detection (`E-DERIVED-ENGINE-CIRCULAR`) lives in
// `dependency-graph.ts` (B16 PHASE 3 in DG); see SECOND-consumer comment
// at `buildEngineDerivedAdj` for the reuse pattern with B7's
// `detectCycle`.
//
// **Walker shape:** AST-driven structural recursion, mirrors PASS 5 / PASS 6
// / PASS 7 / PASS 10.A. Visits every `engine-decl` node; for each derived
// engine (per `_record.engineMeta.derivedExpr !== null`), runs three
// sub-checks (NO-INITIAL on the decl itself; NO-RULES on `rulesRaw`).
// Then visits every `bare-expr` node looking for direct-write or
// `.advance(.X)` shapes whose target ident matches a registered derived-
// engine variable; fires NO-WRITE.
//
// **OUT OF B16 SCOPE:**
//   - `E-DERIVED-ENGINE-INITIAL-UNDEFINED` (runtime, A1c codegen).
//   - General `E-ENGINE-INVALID-TRANSITION` on non-derived engines (B15 +
//     A1c per audit §1.3).
//   - `<onTransition>` and `effect=` validation (B17, uniformly, per
//     §51.0.J line 20409 — these are LEGAL on derived-engine state-children).
//   - Move-14-shape state-child structural walking (awaits ast-builder).

 *
 * **Why exclude `legacy-source-var`:** The legacy §51.9 derived/projection

 *
 * Today's parser (ast-builder.js line 8449) only emits the legacy form

// Per SPEC §51.0.F (v0.3 Option-d synthesis), self-writes to an engine cell

// THIS WALKER handles the CONSERVATIVE outside-state-child case: writes from
// function bodies, top-level logic blocks, event handlers OUTSIDE any engine
// state-child body. The current variant is NOT statically known at these
// sites — but if the target is a literal `.Variant` matching the engine's
// declared variants, the write IS A SELF-WRITE WHENEVER the runtime current
// variant happens to equal that target. Per v0.3 Option-d, that's a no-op.
//
// Fire condition: `@<varName> = .<Variant>` OR `@<varName>.advance(.<Variant>)`
// where `<varName>` resolves to a NON-DERIVED engine cell AND `<Variant>` is
// listed in the engine's `meta.variants`. Severity: info.
//
// This is INTENTIONALLY CONSERVATIVE — it surfaces an opportunity for the
// adopter to verify intent ("this write may be a no-op when you weren't

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PASS 13 (B17) — components-vs-engines residual fire-site (M20, §51.0.K)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per Phase A1b Step B17 (audit §1.2 + §2 brief #6; SPEC §51.0.K, §34):
//
//   §51.0.K: "A component declaration body contains an `<engine>` element"
//   is forbidden. Engines are singletons; instantiating a component multiple
//   times would produce multiple "singletons", violating the singleton
//   invariant. Fire `E-COMPONENT-ENGINE-SCOPE` (§34).
//
//   The S67 §51.0.K Machine Cohesion footnote (line 20453-20454) reaffirms:
//   "Engines MAY NOT be declared inside component bodies (E-COMPONENT-
//   ENGINE-SCOPE)."
//
// **Fire-site ownership history (B14 audit §1.5 + B17 audit §1.2):**
//
//   The B14 audit recommended B14 fire E-COMPONENT-ENGINE-SCOPE at the
//   engine-decl walk site. B14 deferred to B17 because component-def
//   bodies (`component-def.raw: string`) are not parsed as walkable AST
//   children today — engine-decls inside the markup body are not
//   reachable from the AST walker. B17 inherits this deferral.
//
// **What B17 fires today (per Phase 0 survey):**
//
//   `component-def.defChildren` — an array of sibling AST nodes consumed
//   after a component-def in the same logic-body parent (per
//   ast-builder.js line 8647-8663). These nodes are conceptually scoped
//   to the component (used for component-local CSS, scoped helpers,
//   etc.) and ARE walkable AST. An `engine-decl` in defChildren violates
//   §51.0.K Machine Cohesion: the engine would be component-scoped, but
//   engines are file-scope-or-nested-engine-only.
//
//   Note: today's parser pipeline NEVER places `engine-decl` AST nodes
//   inside a logic-body (per ast-builder.js line 9149-9151: "engine-decl
//   nodes are children of markup (program), not logic"), so the walker
//   does not fire end-to-end via the parser today. The walker is
//   defensive scaffolding that fires correctly the moment a future
//   precondition step (component-body markup parser, or relaxation of
//   the engine placement rule) makes the shape reachable. A synthesized
//   AST test exercises the walker today; end-to-end parser tests are
//   `.skip`-ed pending preconditions.
//
// **What B17 still DEFERS (audit §2 brief items 1-5, 7):**
//
//   - `effect=` placement + form validation (engine state-children not parsed)
//   - `<onTransition>` placement + direction attributes (element not tokenized)
//   - E-COMPONENT-ENGINE-SCOPE for engine-decl inside the component-def
//     `raw` markup body (component body markup not parsed)
//   - Engine mount tag `<EngineName/>` inside a component body (same)
//   - `<onTransition>` / `effect=` inside `<match>` arms (block-form match
//     not parsed)
//
//   See `docs/changes/phase-a1b-step-b17-ontransition-component-engine/SURVEY.md`
//   for the precondition catalog.

// `diagnostic` (E-RESET-NO-ARG path), B22 SKIPS that node — the parser has
// already surfaced the malformed-shape error and we don't double-report.

//   - `forEachResetExprInExprNode(node, cb)` from `expression-parser.ts` —
//     full ExprNode-tree walk that visits every reset-expr.
//   - `lookupQualifiedStateCell(scope, path[])` for compound-nav resolution
//     (B12 extension descends through any cell with `_scope`).

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per Phase A1b Step B19 (audit §2 + spec §38.1, §38.4, §34).
//
// **v0.3 DIRECTION REVERSAL (Wave 1, 2026-05-12) + S87 Insight 30
// dispensation (2026-05-12):** The original v0.next / pre-v0.3 contract
// said "channels are file-level siblings of `<program>`" and fired
// `E-CHANNEL-INSIDE-PROGRAM` on a channel descended from another markup
// element. Under the v0.3 program-shape direction (one-program-per-
// application; multi-page apps live as `<page>` siblings inside `<program>`),
// channels move BACK INSIDE `<program>` — channels are app-scope shared-state
// vehicles and the `<program>` body is their home. The walker fires the new
// code `E-CHANNEL-OUTSIDE-PROGRAM` when a `<channel>` sits outside `<program>`
// IN A FILE THAT ALSO CONTAINS `<program>` (the "your-file-has-a-`<program>`-
// but-this-`<channel>`-isn't-inside-it" canonical-violation shape).
// **Module-file dispensation (Insight 30, S87 ratified 47/44/44):** a
// `<channel>` at file top in a MODULE FILE (no `<program>` element anywhere
// in the file — the PURE-CHANNEL-FILE shape per §38.12.6) is canonical
// placement and DOES NOT fire `E-CHANNEL-OUTSIDE-PROGRAM`. Engine-parity
// rationale per §21.8 / B14 (cross-file `<engine>` import from module file).
// The `<channel>` inside `<page>` fire-site (`E-CHANNEL-INSIDE-PAGE`) is filed
// for the wave that adds `<page>` parser support — `<page>` is not
// tokenized as a structural element in Wave 1 so it cannot be checked here.
//
//   §38.1 (v0.3, post-Wave 1; S87 Insight 30 refinement) — channels live
//   INSIDE `<program>` when the file has a `<program>`; module-file
//   PURE-CHANNEL-FILE shape is admitted:
//     "A `<channel>` outside `<program>` IN A FILE THAT ALSO CONTAINS
//      `<program>` SHALL emit `E-CHANNEL-OUTSIDE-PROGRAM`. Dispensation:
//      a `<channel>` at file top in a file with no `<program>` element
//      anywhere (the PURE-CHANNEL-FILE shape per §38.12.6) is canonical
//      and SHALL NOT fire. Engine-parity per §21.8 / B14. A `<channel>`
//      inside `<page>` SHALL emit `E-CHANNEL-INSIDE-PAGE` (channels are
//      app-scope, not per-route)."
//
//   §38.4 line 15468 (V5-strict body — no `@shared`):
//     "The `@shared` modifier SHALL NOT appear in any v0.next source. Use
//      SHALL emit `E-CHANNEL-SHARED-MODIFIER`."
//
//   §38.9 line 15670 reaffirms `@shared` fires "inside (or outside) a
//   channel body" — the fire-site is ANY `state-decl` carrying `isShared:
//   true`, regardless of channel nesting context.
//
// **Why SYM (not parser):** TAB is intentionally permissive (parses any
// v1 shape into the canonical AST shape, leaving validation to SYM/NR).
// SYM is the canonical "validation after AST is fully formed" stage and
// already houses adjacent walkers (B14-B17). Adds cleanly as PASS 14.
//
// **Walker shape:** two independent sub-walks in `walkValidateChannels`,
// preceded by a `hasProgramElement` pre-scan (S87 Insight 30):
//
//   0. `hasProgramElement(ast.nodes)` pre-scan — quick AST walk that
//      returns `true` iff any `kind: "markup", tag: "program"` node is
//      present in the file. Result threaded into walkChannelPlacement
//      as `fileHasProgram`.
//
//   1. `walkChannelPlacement` — walk markup tree carrying a
//      `programDepth` counter (count of `<program>` ancestors) AND the
//      `fileHasProgram` boolean. A `<channel>` at programDepth === 0
//      fires `E-CHANNEL-OUTSIDE-PROGRAM` IFF `fileHasProgram === true`
//      (genuine canonical-violation shape). When `fileHasProgram ===
//      false` (module-file / PURE-CHANNEL-FILE shape), file-top
//      `<channel>` is canonical and the walker is silent. A `<channel>`
//      at programDepth >= 1 is always allowed. (v0.3 reversal + S87
//      Insight 30 — see Wave 1 dispatch + §38.1 v0.3.) The walker
//      descends into `node.children` (markup children) and `node.body`
//      (logic blocks; channels never appear inside logic, but recursion
//      is cheap).
//
//   2. `walkSharedModifier` — generic AST walker visiting every
//      `state-decl` (including compound `children` arrays). Fires
//      E-CHANNEL-SHARED-MODIFIER on any `state-decl` with `isShared:
//      true`. The check is unconditional per §38.4 line 15468 — `@shared`
//      anywhere in source fires the diagnostic.
//
// **Out of scope (per audit §2.1 + brief §"OUT OF SCOPE for B19"):**
//   - V5-strict access validation inside channel body (B3 owns `@cellName`
//     resolution).
//   - Cross-scope channel-cell visibility (B1 PASS 1 + B3 PASS 3 already
//     cover this — channel-body logic-blocks register state-decls in the
//     enclosing file scope).
//   - Channel attribute shape errors (E-CHANNEL-001/E-CHANNEL-005/
//     E-CHANNEL-007 — codegen-time today).
//   - A1c codegen for channels — runtime concern.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per Phase A7 Step A5-3 (BRIEF + Phase 0 SURVEY at
// `docs/changes/phase-a7-step-a5-3-typer-walker/{BRIEF,SURVEY}.md`).
//
// **In-scope fire-sites (9 of 12 BRIEF §4.1 rows):**
//
//   1. E-HISTORY-NO-INNER-ENGINE (NEW S68 row 14250) — fired when a
//      state-child carries `historyAttr: true` AND `innerEngines.length === 0`
//      (history is composite-only per §51.0.N).
//
//   2. E-INTERNAL-RULE-NOT-COMPOSITE (NEW S68 row 14251) — fired when
//      `internalRule.kind !== "absent"` AND `innerEngines.length === 0`
//      (`internal:rule=` is composite-only per §51.0.O).
//
//   3. E-ENGINE-INVALID-TRANSITION (existing row 14234) — fired when
//      `<onTimeout to=.X/>` does not satisfy the surrounding state-child's
//      `rule=` legality contract (§51.0.M + §51.0.F target-only forms).
//      THIS IS THE FIRST COMPILE-TIME E-ENGINE-INVALID-TRANSITION FIRE-SITE
//      (per SURVEY §1.3 KEY FINDING #1; spec §51.0.M line 20567 explicitly
//      authorizes static check because the from-state IS this state-child).
//
//   4. E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT (existing row 14248) — fired when
//      `<onTimeout to=.X/>` references a variant `X` not in the engine's
//      `for=Type` (§51.0.M variant-membership requirement). Independent
//      of fire-site #3 — both can fire on the same `<onTimeout/>`.
//
//   5. E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT — same code, applied to each target
//      in `entry.internalRule` (§51.0.O — internal:rule= variants must
//      be valid). Mirrors B15's canonical-rule variant validation.
//
// **Transparent fire-sites (no new code; B15 already fires):**
//
//   - `.Variant.history` target variant validation (§51.0.N) — A5-2's
//     `historyForm`/`historyForms` flag rides EngineRuleForm.single/multi
//     transparently; B15 reads `target`/`targets` blind to the flag and
//     fires E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT on unknown variants. A5-3
//     anchors this contract via tests; no new validation code.
//
// **EngineMetadata file-scope aggregation (§4.2 + SURVEY §4):**
//
//   - `historyAttr: boolean` — OR-reduce over `stateChildren[].historyAttr`.
//   - `internalRules: Array<{ stateChildTag, rule }>` — concat where
//     `internalRule.kind !== "absent"`, annotated for codegen consumers.
//   - `onTimeoutElements: Array<{ stateChildTag, entry }>` — concat across
//     state-children, annotated for codegen consumers.
//
// **Out of scope (DEFERRED on infrastructure preconditions, per SURVEY
// §10 SCOPE CORRECTIONS):**
//
//   - Fire-site #5 (E-STRUCTURAL-ELEMENT-MISPLACED for `<onTimeout>`
//     outside engine state-child) — gated on a markup walker that
//     tokenizes `<onTimeout>` as a structural element everywhere. Same
//     precondition that defers `<onTransition>` placement enforcement
//     (B17 deferral).
//   - Fire-site #6 (E-STRUCTURAL-ELEMENT-MISPLACED inside `<match>`
//     block-form arm) — same precondition.
//   - Fire-site #7 (cascade-miss message extension on E-ENGINE-INVALID-
//     TRANSITION) — gated on direct-write compile-time enforcement
//     inside engine state-child bodies; that fire-site does not exist
//     today (engine bodies are RAW TEXT — no walkable children, per
//     `symbol-table.ts:4150,4544` deferrals).
//   - Inner-engine structural recursion — DEFERRED to A1c codegen (per
//     SURVEY §3.3). A5-3's primary fire-sites read OUTER engine's
//     state-children only; `innerEngines.length > 0` is the composite
//     marker. A5-3 does NOT recurse into inner engines.
//
// **Walker placement: NEW PASS 16** (per BRIEF §3.8 + SURVEY §2). PASS 11
// (B15) retains responsibility for canonical rule= variant validation
// (which already covers fire-site #9 transparently); A5-3 PASS 16 owns
// only the NEW responsibilities listed above.

// PASS 17 (B17.3) — `<onTransition>` + `effect=` typer diagnostics (§51.0.H + §51.0.F)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per Phase A1b Step B17.3 (BRIEF + SURVEY at
// `docs/changes/phase-a1b-step-b17-3-typer-diagnostics-ontransition-effect/{BRIEF,SURVEY}.md`).
//
// Consumes B17.2's parser annotations on `EngineStateChildEntry`:
//   - `effectRaw: string | null` — the inner expression text of `effect=${...}`
//     attribute on the state-child opener (or `null` when absent).
//   - `onTransitionElements: OnTransitionEntry[]` — `<onTransition>` siblings
//     parsed out of the state-child body, each with `to/from/once/ifExprRaw/bodyRaw`.
//
// **In-scope fire-sites (5 — STANDARD shape per S74 BRIEF Q1+Q2 ratification):**
//
//   1. E-ENGINE-EFFECT-AMBIGUOUS (existing §34 row 14377; §51.0.H line 20471) —
//      `entry.effectRaw != null && entry.rule.kind === "multi"`. `effect=` is
//      single-target only; combining with multi-target rule= is ambiguous (which
//      target triggers it?).
//
//   2. E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT (existing §34 row 14467) for
//      `<onTransition to=.X>` — `entry.to != null && entry.to NOT IN engineMeta.variants`.
//      Mirrors A5-3 PASS 16 fire-site #4 pattern (same code reused for `<onTimeout to=>`).
//
//   3. E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT (same code as #2) for `<onTransition from=.X>` —
//      `entry.from != null && entry.from NOT IN engineMeta.variants`. Same pattern.
//
//   4. E-ENGINE-INVALID-TRANSITION (existing §34 row 14376; §51.0.F rule= contract) —
//      compile-time fire when an `<onTransition to=.X>` placed in a FROM-state-child
//      (i.e., in this state-child whose body it sits in) does NOT satisfy the surrounding
//      `rule=` legality. Mirrors A5-3 PASS 16 fire-site #3 (same pattern as `<onTimeout
//      to=.X>`). The from-state IS this state-child (`sc.tag`); the to-state must be
//      permitted by `sc.rule`.
//
//      Wildcard `rule=*` accepts any target — never fires.
//      Multi-target `rule=(.A | .B)` — `entry.to` must be in `[.A, .B]`.
//      Single-target `rule=.A` — `entry.to` must be `.A`.
//      Absent rule (terminal state) — fires for ANY `entry.to`.
//
//   5. E-ONTRANSITION-NO-TARGET (NEW §34 row at S74 — A1b B17.3) —
//      `entry.to == null && entry.from == null`. The handler has no trigger.
//      Per §51.0.H attribute table, exactly one of `to=` / `from=` MUST appear.
//
// **Out of scope (DEFERRED on infrastructure or scope-OUT per BRIEF):**
//
//   - `<onTransition>` placement OUTSIDE engine state-child (E-STRUCTURAL-ELEMENT-MISPLACED)
//     — same precondition that defers A5-3 fire-sites #5/#6 (markup walker that
//     tokenizes `<onTransition>` everywhere).
//   - `if=expr` type-checking — DEFERRED per SURVEY decision 2 (engine bodies are
//     RAW TEXT today; expression-typer doesn't see `ifExprRaw` content).
//   - `<onTransition>` BODY type-checking — body-rendering wide step territory.
//   - `from=.X` cross-state-child consistency check — future C-step (codegen
//     correlates `from=.X` placements against the FROM-state-child's `rule=`).
//   - Inner-engine recursion — A1c codegen territory; PASS 17 walks the OUTER
//     engine's state-children only (composite marker is `innerEngines.length > 0`).
//
// **EngineRuleForm shapes mapping (to fire-site #1 + #4):**
//
//   - `kind: "single"` → effect= LEGAL (no fire-site #1); fire-site #4 checks
//     `entry.to === r.target`.
//   - `kind: "multi"` → effect= AMBIGUOUS (fire-site #1); fire-site #4 checks
//     `r.targets.includes(entry.to)`.
//   - `kind: "wildcard"` → effect= LEGAL per the BRIEF predicate (`kind === "multi"`
//     ONLY fires E-ENGINE-EFFECT-AMBIGUOUS; wildcard does NOT). Fire-site #4 always
//     passes (wildcard accepts any target).
//   - `kind: "absent"` → effect= LEGAL technically (no transitions to fire on, so
//     effect= never runs — semantically inert; no fire-site #1 since rule.kind is
//     not "multi"). Fire-site #4 fires for terminal state on ANY `entry.to`.
//   - `kind: "legacy-arrow" / "parse-error"` → SKIP fire-site #4 (B15 already
//     fired on the malformed rule=; B17.3 does NOT double-fire misleading legality
//     diagnostics against a structurally-broken rule).

// Parser-recognition for `pinned fn` landed S105 commit `dc3c460` — the

// (`pinned fn`, `pinned async fn`, `pinned pure fn`, `pinned server fn`,
// `pinned async server fn`, `pinned pure server fn`). This PASS 19 closes
// the semantic-enforcement half: per SPEC §48.6.4, `pinned fn` opts the
// declaration OUT of hoisting per §6.10, and forward references SHALL fire
// E-STATE-PINNED-FORWARD-REF (§34 — same diagnostic used for pinned state
// cells + pinned imports at PASS 3's B4 fire-paths).
//
// Walker shape mirrors PASS 3 (walkResolveAtNames): structural recursion,
// readPos tracked via nodeReadPos, ExprNode payloads inspected via
// B3_EXPR_FIELDS. The check itself uses `forEachCallInExprNode` (sibling of
// `forEachIdentInExprNode`) to visit every CallExpr in the tree, then tests
// bare-ident callees against the pinned-fn map.
//
// Map population: walk the AST once via `collectPinnedFunctionDecls` (a
// scoped variant of test-bind's `collectSameFileFunctionDecls`); only nodes
// with `isPinned === true` populate the map. When the map is empty (no
// `pinned fn` in the file), PASS 19 returns early — zero performance cost.
