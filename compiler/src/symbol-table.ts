/**
 * Symbol Table — Stage 3.06 of the scrml compiler pipeline (SYM).
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B1 — V5-strict symbol-table extension. This module
 * constructs a per-scope state-cell registry over the FileAST produced by
 * TAB and decorated by NR. It is FOUNDATIONAL infrastructure that
 * subsequent A1b steps (B2 onward) build on:
 *
 *   B2 — V5-strict bare-name resolution + E-NAME-COLLIDES-STATE  [LANDED]
 *   B3 — `@name` resolution → record back-pointer on each ExprNode  [LANDED]
 *   B4 — Import binding + `pinned` forward-ref cycle detection
 *   B5 — Cell classifier (bindable, markup-typed, derived-with-validators)  [LANDED]
 *   B6 — Render-by-tag E-CELL-NO-RENDER-SPEC + E-CELL-RENDER-SPEC-NOT-BINDABLE
 *   B7 — Derived-cell dep DAG + E-DERIVED-CIRCULAR-DEP
 *   B8 — L21 walker (E-DERIVED-VALUE-MUTATE + E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE)
 *   B11/B12 — Validity-surface synthesized cells (re-entrancy invariant)
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B2 — V5-strict bare-name resolution. The walker now also
 * visits `let-decl`, `const-decl`, `tilde-decl`, and `lin-decl` nodes (the
 * four local declaration kinds). For each local-decl, looks up the decl's
 * name in the current scope (via `lookupStateCell`'s parent-chain walk). If
 * a registered state-cell record is found at any enclosing scope, fires
 * `E-NAME-COLLIDES-STATE` per SPEC §6.1.3 + §34. Local names cannot shadow
 * registered state-cell names — the V5-strict invariant.
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B5 — Cell classifier. PASS 4 walks every registered
 * `state-decl` (via the per-scope `stateCells` map populated in PASS 1) and
 * stamps a `_cellKind` discriminant + `_isBindable` boolean on the AST decl
 * node. Four kinds:
 *
 *   - `"plain"`        — Shape 1 mutable cell (`<count> = 0`) OR Shape 3
 *                        derived with non-markup RHS (`const <doubled> = @count * 2`).
 *   - `"bindable"`     — Shape 2 with `renderSpec.element.tag` in
 *                        {input, textarea, select} (canonical bindable set,
 *                        per `codegen/emit-html.ts` BIND_DIRECTIVE_TAGS).
 *   - `"markup-typed"` — Shape 3 derived with markup RHS (e.g.,
 *                        `const <badge> = <span>...</span>`) OR a non-bindable
 *                        Shape 2 markup-RHS (defensively classified; A1b/B6
 *                        may later reject as illegal Shape-2).
 *   - `"compound-parent"` — Variant C compound (`<formRes> { <name> = ""; ... }`).
 *                           Children classify recursively as standalone state-decls
 *                           in the compound's sub-scope.
 *
 * Per A1b plan §4.6 line 230, B5 RECORDS classification (annotates AST only);
 * B6 will FIRE `E-CELL-NO-RENDER-SPEC` + `E-CELL-RENDER-SPEC-NOT-BINDABLE`
 * based on the `_cellKind` annotation. B7 will filter to plain/markup-typed
 * + isConst when building the derived-cell dep DAG.
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B3 — `@name` resolution. PASS 3 walks every ExprNode payload
 * on every AST node and, for each `@`-prefixed `IdentExpr`, calls
 * `lookupStateCell(currentScope, name.slice(1))`. The result (a
 * `StateCellRecord` or `null`) is stamped onto the IdentExpr as a
 * non-enumerable `_resolvedStateCell` field. This is the annotated-AST
 * contract that B5+ (cell classifier), B7 (derived-cell dep DAG), B10
 * (validator typer cross-field args), and B22 (`reset(@cell)` keyword)
 * consume to know which cell each `@name` read points to without
 * re-resolving by string lookup. Per A1b plan §4.6 line 228, B3 RECORDS
 * resolution; the resolution-fail catch-all is "existing infra" — B3 stamps
 * `null` on failed lookups (no new error code). Compound nav (`@form.name`)
 * resolves the BASE cell only at B3; deeper path resolution defers to
 * `lookupQualifiedStateCell` consumers when leaf-level resolution is needed.
 *
 * What B1 lands:
 *   - A `Scope` data structure (per-file root, child scopes for function /
 *     engine / component / compound state-decl bodies) with a `stateCells`
 *     `Map<string, StateCellRecord>`.
 *   - A registration walker that visits every `state-decl` node (both
 *     `structuralForm:true` `<x> = init` and `structuralForm:false` legacy
 *     `@x = init`) and registers its name in the containing scope.
 *   - Variant C compound (§6.3) recursive registration: parent name in the
 *     enclosing scope; children registered in the parent's compound sub-scope
 *     under qualified-path keys (e.g., `signup.name`).
 *   - Annotated AST: each `state-decl` gains a `_record: StateCellRecord`
 *     back-pointer; each scope-introducing node gains a `_scope: Scope`
 *     back-pointer; FileAST gains a top-level `_scope: Scope`.
 *   - Public lookup API: `lookupStateCell` (parent-chain walk),
 *     `lookupQualifiedStateCell` (multi-segment paths), `getScopeForNode`
 *     (reverse lookup).
 *
 * What B1 + B2 do NOT do (handled by later B-steps):
 *   - Resolve `@name` reads. B3 walks ExprNode trees and records the
 *     resolution back-pointer.
 *   - Synthesize validity-surface cells (`@compound.isValid` etc.). B11/B12
 *     synthesize and add records to existing scopes via the `_scope`
 *     back-pointer (re-entrancy invariant per BRIEF §6).
 *   - Walk engine state-children or component bodies. Today's AST stores
 *     `engine-decl.rulesRaw: string` and `component-def.raw: string` (no
 *     walkable children), so engine + component scope construction defers
 *     to B14+/B17+. The `ScopeKind` enum reserves `"engine"` and
 *     `"component"` for those steps; B1's walker fills `"file"`,
 *     `"function"`, and `"compound"` only.
 *
 * Performance budget: <= 5 ms per file (single AST traversal + Map inserts).
