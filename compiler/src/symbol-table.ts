/**
 * Symbol Table — Stage 3.06 of the scrml compiler pipeline (SYM).
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B1 — V5-strict symbol-table extension. This module
 * constructs a per-scope state-cell registry over the FileAST produced by
 * TAB and decorated by NR. It is FOUNDATIONAL infrastructure that
 * subsequent A1b steps (B2 onward) build on:
 *
 *   B2 — V5-strict bare-name resolution + E-NAME-COLLIDES-STATE  [LANDED]
 *   B3 — `@name` resolution → record back-pointer on each ExprNode  [LANDED]
 *   B4 — Import binding registration + source-position `pinned` forward-ref
 *        check (E-STATE-PINNED-FORWARD-REF) + best-effort
 *        E-IMPORT-PINNED-INVALID  [LANDED]
 *   B5 — Cell classifier (bindable, markup-typed, derived-with-validators)  [LANDED]
 *   B6 — Render-by-tag E-CELL-NO-RENDER-SPEC + E-CELL-RENDER-SPEC-NOT-BINDABLE
 *   B7 — Derived-cell dep DAG + E-DERIVED-CIRCULAR-DEP
 *   B8 — L21 walker (E-DERIVED-VALUE-MUTATE + E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE)
 *   B11/B12 — Validity-surface synthesized cells (re-entrancy invariant)
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B2 — V5-strict bare-name resolution. The walker now also
 * visits `let-decl`, `const-decl`, `tilde-decl`, and `lin-decl` nodes (the
 * four local declaration kinds). For each local-decl, looks up the decl's
 * name in the current scope (via `lookupStateCell`'s parent-chain walk). If
 * a registered state-cell record is found at any enclosing scope, fires
 * `E-NAME-COLLIDES-STATE` per SPEC §6.1.3 + §34. Local names cannot shadow
 * registered state-cell names — the V5-strict invariant.
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B5 — Cell classifier. PASS 4 walks every registered
 * `state-decl` (via the per-scope `stateCells` map populated in PASS 1) and
 * stamps a `_cellKind` discriminant + `_isBindable` boolean on the AST decl
 * node. Four kinds:
 *
 *   - `"plain"`        — Shape 1 mutable cell (`<count> = 0`) OR Shape 3
 *                        derived with non-markup RHS (`const <doubled> = @count * 2`).
 *   - `"bindable"`     — Shape 2 with `renderSpec.element.tag` in
 *                        {input, textarea, select} (canonical bindable set,
 *                        per `codegen/emit-html.ts` BIND_DIRECTIVE_TAGS).
 *   - `"markup-typed"` — Shape 3 derived with markup RHS (e.g.,
 *                        `const <badge> = <span>...</span>`) OR a non-bindable
 *                        Shape 2 markup-RHS (defensively classified; A1b/B6
 *                        may later reject as illegal Shape-2).
 *   - `"compound-parent"` — Variant C compound (`<formRes> { <name> = ""; ... }`).
 *                           Children classify recursively as standalone state-decls
 *                           in the compound's sub-scope.
 *
 * Per A1b plan §4.6 line 230, B5 RECORDS classification (annotates AST only);
 * B6 will FIRE `E-CELL-NO-RENDER-SPEC` + `E-CELL-RENDER-SPEC-NOT-BINDABLE`
 * based on the `_cellKind` annotation. B7 will filter to plain/markup-typed
 * + isConst when building the derived-cell dep DAG.
 *
 * Phase A1b Step B3 — `@name` resolution. PASS 3 walks every ExprNode payload
 * on every AST node and, for each `@`-prefixed `IdentExpr`, calls
 * `lookupStateCell(currentScope, name.slice(1))`. The result (a
 * `StateCellRecord` or `null`) is stamped onto the IdentExpr as a
 * non-enumerable `_resolvedStateCell` field. This is the annotated-AST
 * contract that B5+ (cell classifier), B7 (derived-cell dep DAG), B10
 * (validator typer cross-field args), and B22 (`reset(@cell)` keyword)
 * consume to know which cell each `@name` read points to without
 * re-resolving by string lookup. Per A1b plan §4.6 line 228, B3 RECORDS
 * resolution; the resolution-fail catch-all is "existing infra" — B3 stamps
 * `null` on failed lookups (no new error code). Compound nav (`@form.name`)
 * resolves the BASE cell only at B3; deeper path resolution defers to
 * `lookupQualifiedStateCell` consumers when leaf-level resolution is needed.
 *
 * What B1 lands:
 *   - A `Scope` data structure (per-file root, child scopes for function /
 *     engine / component / compound state-decl bodies) with a `stateCells`
 *     `Map<string, StateCellRecord>`.
 *   - A registration walker that visits every `state-decl` node (both
 *     `structuralForm:true` `<x> = init` and `structuralForm:false` legacy
 *     `@x = init`) and registers its name in the containing scope.
 *   - Variant C compound (§6.3) recursive registration: parent name in the
 *     enclosing scope; children registered in the parent's compound sub-scope
 *     under qualified-path keys (e.g., `signup.name`).
 *   - Annotated AST: each `state-decl` gains a `_record: StateCellRecord`
 *     back-pointer; each scope-introducing node gains a `_scope: Scope`
 *     back-pointer; FileAST gains a top-level `_scope: Scope`.
 *   - Public lookup API: `lookupStateCell` (parent-chain walk),
 *     `lookupQualifiedStateCell` (multi-segment paths), `getScopeForNode`
 *     (reverse lookup).
 *
 * What B1 + B2 do NOT do (handled by later B-steps):
 *   - Resolve `@name` reads. B3 walks ExprNode trees and records the
 *     resolution back-pointer.
 *   - Synthesize validity-surface cells (`@compound.isValid` etc.). B11/B12
 *     synthesize and add records to existing scopes via the `_scope`
 *     back-pointer (re-entrancy invariant per BRIEF §6).
 *   - Walk engine state-children or component bodies. Today's AST stores
 *     `engine-decl.rulesRaw: string` and `component-def.raw: string` (no
 *     walkable children), so engine + component scope construction defers
 *     to B14+/B17+. The `ScopeKind` enum reserves `"engine"` and
 *     `"component"` for those steps; B1's walker fills `"file"`,
 *     `"function"`, and `"compound"` only.
 *
 * Performance budget: <= 5 ms per file (single AST traversal + Map inserts).

// §4.6 line 228; the resolution-fail catch-all is "existing infra").
//
// Why non-enumerable: the resolved record back-points to its scope which

// via `lookupQualifiedStateCell` using the parsed path.

 * source-position precedes the pinned cell's (or pinned import's) decl-span
 * end.
 *
 * **Read-position note (load-bearing).** IdentExpr `span` values are produced
 * by `expression-parser.ts → spanFromEstree(node, file, baseOffset)`. When an
 * ExprNode is parsed via `safeParseExprToNode` from inside an isolated
 * substring (function bodies / interpolation segments), `baseOffset` is 0 —
 * so the IdentExpr's `span.start` is the offset WITHIN the substring, not
 * within the whole source file. That makes IdentExpr spans unsuitable as
 * absolute read-positions for the source-position forward-ref check.
 *
 * The fallback is the **enclosing AST node's `span.start`** — passed in via
 * the walker as `readPos`. Every container that B3 traverses
 * (`function-decl`, `state-decl`, statement nodes, etc.) has an absolute
 * span set by ast-builder. That position is the lower bound of the read's
 * source-position; using it is conservative-correct:
 *
 *   - `function f() { return @x } ; <x pinned> = 0` — function.span.start
 *     (~14) < x.span.end (~66) → fires (correct).
 *   - `<x pinned> = 0 ; function f() { return @x }` — function.span.start
 *     (>x.span.end) → no fire (correct).
 *   - `<x pinned> = @x + 1` — state-decl.span.start (=decl.span.start)
 *     < decl.span.end → fires (self-init; correct per spec).
 *
 * The conservative aspect: a read at `function.start + 50` syntactically
 * AFTER a pinned decl that sits at `function.start + 100` would still see
 * the read-position as `function.start`. But that scenario can't occur:
 * pinned decls live at file/program scope and at compound scope, never
 * inside function bodies — function bodies don't open a state-cell decl
 * surface. So the read-position approximation is exact for the cases the
 * spec normatively addresses.

//          (`<formRes><field/></>`) and `${@formRes.field}` interpolation as
//          spec-canonical alternatives.
//
//   §3.2 — Component RHS render-specs (PascalCase tag in the decl's renderSpec,
//          e.g., `<x> = <MyComp/>`) are DEFERRED. SPEC line 1341 requires
//          component-prop-catalog inspection (B14/M18/M20 territory); B6 v1

//          (`<MyComponent/>` in markup) are also accepted — the lowercase-tag
//          predicate filters them out before lookup.
//
// **Use-site detection.** A render-by-tag use is:
//   1. `node.kind === "markup"`

// Step 3 is the deferral filter (Phase 0 §3.2). Step 4 is the decisive filter
// — HTML built-ins (`<br/>`, `<input/>`, `<img/>`, ...) are also self-closed
// lowercase markup, but they don't resolve to a state cell, so the walker
// no-ops on them.
//
// **Scope handling.** B6 uses file-scope lookup (`lookupStateCell(fileScope,
// tag)`). Compound sub-scope cells are not addressable as bare `<childName/>`
// from outside the compound — they're addressed as `<parent><childName/></>`
// (the wrapping form, SPEC line 1882). File-scope lookup matches the spec's

// B8: L21 walker — E-DERIVED-VALUE-MUTATE (PASS 6)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per SPEC §6.6.18 (lock L21), in-place mutation of a `const`-derived cell
// SHALL be rejected at compile time. Three forbidden form classes:
//
//   1. Array mutating method calls — `@derivedArr.push(x)`, etc. (9 methods
//      per §6.5.1: push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, reverse, sort, fill,
//      copyWithin).
//   2. Object property writes / compound-assignments / delete —
//      `@derivedObj.foo = x`, `@derivedObj.foo += 1`, `delete @derivedObj.foo`,
//      and the 14 compound forms (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=,
//      >>=, >>>=, ??=, ||=, &&=).
//   3. In-compound derived sub-cell — `@form.derivedField.method(...)` /
//      `@form.derivedField.foo = x` where `derivedField` is `const`-declared
//      inside a Variant C compound parent.
//
// AST shape paths (per `tests/integration/parse-mutation-shapes.test.js`):
//
//   - `reactive-array-mutation` (specialized lowering, single-segment receiver,
//     method ∈ ARRAY_MUTATIONS) → check via `target` string + `method`.
//   - `reactive-nested-assign` (specialized lowering, `=` only) → check via
//     `target` string + `path[]`.
//   - `bare-expr` containing one of:
//       - `assign` (compound assigns; computed-index assigns; multi-segment
//         receivers; plain `=` on chained members) → check via leaf-ident
//         walk on `target`.
//       - `call` with `callee.kind === "member"` and method name ∈
//         ARRAY_MUTATING_METHODS — covers compound-receiver chains
//         `@form.errors.push(x)`.
//       - `unary` with `op === "delete"` and `argument.kind ∈ {"member",
//         "index"}` → check via leaf-ident walk on `argument`.
//
// **NEXT-STEP HOOK (E-DERIVED-WRITE):** §6.6.18 normative requires this check
// to share a pass with §6.6.8 E-DERIVED-WRITE (reassignment form). When that
// rule is implemented, it should join this walker — `@derived = newval` is an
// `assign` ExprNode whose `target` is a bare ident (not a member chain), so
// the dispatch is a sibling discriminator, not a separate walk.
//
// **OUT OF B8 SCOPE (deferred):**
//   - E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE (§55.7) — depends on B11/B12's synth-cell registry
//     which doesn't exist yet. B11 will extend this walker.
//   - Markup-typed derived cells: per §6.6.18, the rule applies uniformly;
//     markup APIs today expose no mutators so the rule is non-firing in
//     practice but no special exemption is needed in the walker.

//
// Per SPEC §55.1 (universal-core vocabulary, L4) + §55.10 (4-level error
// message resolution chain, L12 Edge F). For every state-decl with
// validators, B10 looks up each validator against the
// `validator-catalog.ts` module's predicate signature catalog and verifies:
//
//   1. Predicate name is in the universal-core (14 predicates per §55.1).
//      Library-surface predicates (`email`/`url`/`numeric`/`integer` from
//      `scrml:data`) are NOT in the universal-core catalog; B10 silently
//      passes through unknown names — a future tightening will register
//      stdlib predicates and convert this to a strict reject.
//
//   2. Arity matches:
//      - bareword (args: null) → must be `arity: 0` or `"0+inline"` predicate
//      - call-form with 1 arg → leading slot must match required-shape
//      - call-form with 2 args → leading slot + trailing inline-message-override
//      - call-form with > 2 args → reject (no spec predicate takes more)
//
//   3. Per-positional-arg shape matches the catalog signature:
//      - `relational-predicate` slot ↔ RelationalPredicateNode (B9 sibling kind)
//      - `regex` slot ↔ ESTree-`Literal`-via-escape-hatch with raw=`/.../`
//                       OR a string literal (alternative-form acceptance)
//      - `numeric` slot ↔ NumLit ExprNode (or numeric-typed expression —
//                          for now any non-string literal accepted; deeper
//                          type-inference deferred)
//      - `comparable-with-cell` / `any-equatable-with-cell` slots ↔ any
//                          ExprNode (full cell-type compatibility deferred
//                          per audit §1.3 cost-control)
//      - `array-of-cell-type` slot ↔ ArrayLit ExprNode
//      - `inline-message-override` slot ↔ string literal (StringLit). Dynamic
//                          override (anything else) is fired as a separate
//                          diagnostic — though B13 ultimately owns the formal
//                          extraction + inline-override-record.
//
// Failures fire `E-TYPE-031` (the existing umbrella per §55.1 line 24295)
// with a per-violation descriptive message.
//
// **DEFERRED to follow-up steps:**
//   - Cell-type compatibility check (`pattern(re)` on a `number` cell): needs
//     type-system.ts type inference. Audit §1.3 budgets this for a later
//     tightening.
//   - B13 owns formal Level-1 inline-override extraction onto the validator
//     record + explicit dynamic-override rejection error code.
//   - Cycle detection (E-VALIDATOR-CIRCULAR-DEP) is Phase 3 of B10 and lives
//     in dependency-graph.ts (Stage 7) per audit §1.4.
//   - B3 cross-field `@cell` resolution is read by Phase 3 (cycle detection);
//     B10 Phase 2 (this walker) does shape checks only.
//
// **WHY HERE (not type-system.ts):** B10's check is symbol-table-shaped —
// iterates state-decls, reads decl.validators, dispatches per-arg. Doesn't
// need full type inference. Follows the B6/B8 walker pattern (PASS 5 / PASS 6).

// four synthesized properties registered into its compound scope:
//
//   `@compound.isValid`   — boolean rollup (true ↔ ALL fields pass validators).
//   `@compound.errors`    — object map { fieldName: [...errorTags] }.
//   `@compound.touched`   — object map { fieldName: bool }.
//   `@compound.submitted` — boolean (compound-level only per §55.7 line 24468).
//
// **Trigger predicate (per audit §1.1):** `_cellKind === "compound-parent"`.
// Synthesis is UNCONDITIONAL for compound parents — even no-validator compounds
// get the surface, with trivially-valid defaults per §55.5 line 24415-24418
// ("predictability over namespace savings"). Single-value Tier-1 cells (L11
// Edge A) DO NOT get the surface (compound parent check filters them naturally).
//
// **Canonical types per §55, NOT §6.11 stub (per audit §1.2):**
//   - compound `errors` is OBJECT MAP keyed by field name (NOT `string[]`).
//   - per-field `errors` (B12 future) is array of `ValidationError` enum tags
//     (NOT singular `error: string`).
//
// **Runtime-hook annotations per §55.7 line 24449-24461 (audit §1.5):**
//   - `isValid`, `errors` are pure reactive derivations → `runtimeHookKind: null`.
//   - `touched` has runtime trigger (bind:value/bind:checked change OR first
//     focus-out) → `runtimeHookKind: "touch"`.
//   - `submitted` has runtime trigger (form's submit handler) →
//     `runtimeHookKind: "submit"`.
//   - B11 RECORDS the hook requirement on each synth record. A1c codegen reads
//     the annotation and emits the actual hook plumbing.
//
// **Cross-field deps via predicate args:** B10 Phase 3 already emits
// `validator-reads` edges in the dep-graph. B11 emits NO new DG edges — the
// reactive wiring for compound rollup (`isValid` reading each field's
// `isValid`) is logically a consequence of the synth records' annotations and
// is materialized by A1c codegen via the existing `validator-reads` machinery.
//
// **`submitted` is COMPOUND-LEVEL ONLY** per §55.7 line 24468 (audit §1.6).
// B12 (per-field surface) MUST NOT register per-field `submitted`.
//
// **E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE** is fired by the EXTENDED PASS 6 walker (see below).
// PASS 8 only registers — diagnostic firing rides on the existing walker

//   `@compound.field.touched` — boolean. Latched on first interaction.
//
// **`submitted` is NOT registered per-field** per §55.7 line 24468 (audit §1.6
// boundary clarification) — `submitted` is compound-level only.
//
// **Trigger predicate (per audit §1.1):** EVERY compound child gets the per-
// field surface, regardless of whether the child has validators. Per §55.6
// (L11 Edge B): "Per L11 Edge B, a per-field surface exists EVEN when the
// field has no validators". Predictability over selectivity (audit §1.1
// substantive drift correction — SCOPE wording "per validator-tagged child
// cell" was narrower than the spec).
//
// **Type shapes per §55.6, NOT §6.11 stub (audit §1.3):**
//   - per-field `errors` is ARRAY of `ValidationError` enum tags (NOT
//     singular `error: string`).
//
// **Runtime-hook annotations** (audit §1.6):
//   - per-field `isValid` and `errors` are pure-reactive → `null`.
//   - per-field `touched` is event-driven (bind:value/bind:checked change OR
//     focus-out) → `"touch"`. Per-field timing per §55.7 line 24457.
//
// **Per-field scope shape:** B12 attaches a `kind: "field"` `Scope` onto each
// compound child's decl node via `declNode._scope`. The three per-field synth
// records register into this scope. `lookupQualifiedStateCell` was extended
// to descend through ANY cell that has `_scope` (not just compound parents),
// so `@signup.name.isValid` resolves naturally via the existing API.
//
// **Cross-field deps:** B10 Phase 3 already wires `validator-reads` edges in
// the dep-graph (via `forEachIdentInValidatorArg` walking `@signup.password`
// references in `eq(@signup.password)` validator args). B12 emits NO new DG
// edges — the cross-field reactive wiring is materialized by A1c codegen
// reading the synth-record annotations + the existing edge machinery
// (mirrors B11's stance per audit §1.5 + B11 spec §"NO new DG edges").
//
// **E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE per-field scope:** B11 fires E-SYNTHESIZED-WRITE only
// at compound scope (`@signup.isValid = false`). B12 extends the same PASS 6
// walker to fire on per-field writes (`@signup.name.isValid = false`).
// Implementation: relax B11's `hit.path.length !== receiverPath.length`
// guard to ALSO accept the case where the prefix resolves to a compound +
// the next segment is a registered field (the synth-property is the leaf).
// `findDeepestRegisteredOnPrefix` walks longest→shortest (B8's helper); for
// `@signup.name.isValid` the deepest registered prefix is `["signup","name"]`
// (the field cell), and the leaf `isValid` is the synth-property name. The
// extension is depth-2 instead of depth-1.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per SPEC §55.14 (validators on derived cells: REJECTED) + §55.10 (4-level
// error message resolution chain). Two responsibilities, one walker pass:
//
//   1. **E-DERIVED-WITH-VALIDATORS rejection** — every state-decl with
//      `isConst === true` AND non-empty validators fires the diagnostic.
//      Per audit §1.7 + §55.14 line 24692, the message recommends the
//      refinement-type alternative (`const <x>: number(>=0) = ...`).
//
//      Per audit §1.5: engine auto-declared variables are NOT `isConst`, so
//      they pass through silently — engine-cell validators are LEGAL but
//      typically REDUNDANT per §55.14. Engine-derived (`<engine derived=>`)
//      with validators is REJECTED per §55.14 line 24689 but requires
//      engine-decl annotations not yet present (B14 sequencing). The walker's
//      `state-decl` filter skips engine-decls; the engine-derived case is
//      deferred to a B13.5/B14 follow-up.
//
//   2. **Level-1 inline-override extraction** — for non-derived cells with
//      validators, walk each `ValidatorEntry` and extract the trailing
//      string-literal arg as `inlineOverride: string` on the entry, when the
//      catalog declares an `inline-message-override` slot for that predicate
//      and the runtime arg-list has the slot populated. When the trailing
//      slot is present but the arg is NOT a static string literal, fire
//      `E-VALIDATOR-INLINE-DYNAMIC` (per L12 Edge F static-string rule).
//
// **Walker type:** AST-driven structural recursion, mirrors PASS 5 / PASS 6 /
// PASS 7 / PASS 8. Runs FOR FREE on top of B5 (cellKind), B9 (ExprNode args),
// B10 (catalog) — no new infrastructure.

 *     validator names) and skip per-validator processing on this cell.
 *   - Else (non-derived) → for each validator, extract Level-1 inline
 *     override (if present) onto `validator.inlineOverride`; fire
 *     E-VALIDATOR-INLINE-DYNAMIC if the inline-override slot is populated
 *     by a non-string-literal expression.

//
// PASS 10.A — REGISTER ENGINE CELLS:
//   Walks every `engine-decl` AST node in the file. For each:
//     1. Compute the auto-declared variable name per §51.0.C — derived from
//        the engine's `for=Type` (lowercase-first-character of the type name)
//        UNLESS `var=NAME` is present (override). Legacy `name=` is preserved
//        as a back-compat path.
//     2. Validate the chosen var name against existing same-scope state cells:
//        if a non-engine state-cell already exists with this name, fire
//        `E-ENGINE-VAR-DUPLICATE` (§51.0.C, §34) — the engine OWNS its
//        variable.
//     3. Register a `StateCellRecord` with `_cellKind: "engine"` + an

//   binding in the file scope. For each such tag, looks up the source
//   export's category via the MOD exportRegistry:
//     - If `category === "engine"`: legitimate cross-file mount; no record
//       registration required (the imported singleton is the cell).
//     - Else: fire `E-ENGINE-MOUNT-NOT-ENGINE` (added to §34 by this dispatch
//       — see audit §1.3) with the offending category and a remediation hint.
//
//   Engine awareness in MOD's exportRegistry is a precondition: today's
//   exportRegistry maps `kind: "const" | "type" | "function" | "channel"
//   | ...` and `category: "user-component" | "channel" | "type" |
//   "function" | "const" | "other"`. B14 extends MOD to recognize

//   `module-resolver.js:buildExportRegistry`.
//
// PASS 10.C — E-COMPONENT-ENGINE-SCOPE (§51.0.K, deferred):
//   Today's AST stores component-def bodies as raw text (`component-def.raw:

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Per Phase A1b Step B15 (audit §2 seven-point brief; SPEC §51.0.B/E/F/G,
// §34 catalog rows added by this dispatch):
//
// PASS 11 — VALIDATE ENGINE STATE-CHILDREN + RULE= + INITIAL=:
//   Walks every `engine-decl` AST node in the file. For each:
//
//     1. Populate `engineMeta.variants` from the file's typeRegistry (read
//        from `ast.typeDecls[]` — `parseEnumVariantsFromRaw` extracts
//        variant names). B14 left this empty; B15 populates here so
//        downstream consumers (B16, A1c) can read variants directly.
//
//     2. Validate `initial=` per §51.0.E. For NON-derived engines:
//          - absent → fire `W-ENGINE-INITIAL-MISSING` (lint; defaults to
//            first variant for codegen).
//          - present-but-not-a-valid-variant → fire
//            `E-ENGINE-INITIAL-INVALID-VARIANT`.
//        Derived engines (`derivedExpr !== null`) are SKIPPED — B16 owns
//        derived-specific rejections (E-DERIVED-ENGINE-NO-INITIAL).
//
//     3. Parse `engine-decl.rulesRaw` into state-children via
//        `parseEngineStateChildren` (engine-statechild-parser.ts). Skips
//        legacy `<machine>` arrow-rule bodies (the type-system handles
//        those via parseMachineRules).
//
//     4. Validate state-child exhaustiveness per §51.0.B + §51.0.F:
//          - For each variant of `engineMeta.variants`: confirm a state-
//            child with matching PascalCase tag exists. Missing → fire
//            `E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-MISSING`.
//          - For each state-child: confirm its tag is a variant. Unknown
//            → fire `E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-INVALID-VARIANT`.
//        Applied uniformly across non-derived AND derived engines (per
//        audit §1.3 — derived engines also list variants).
//
//     5. Validate `rule=` forms per §51.0.F three target-only forms:
//          - single-target / multi-target: every `.Variant` referenced
//            must be in `engineMeta.variants`. Mismatch → fire
//            `E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT`.
//          - wildcard `*`: legal; no fire.
//          - legacy event-arrow form (`event -> Variant`): fire
//            `E-ENGINE-RULE-LEGACY-SYNTAX`.
//          - parse-error: fire `E-ENGINE-RULE-INVALID-VARIANT` (carries
//            the parser's diagnostic reason).
//
//     6. Records the parsed state-child entries onto
//        `engineMeta.stateChildren` for downstream B16 / B17 / A1c
//        consumption.
//
// **DEFERRED (per audit §1.4 + B15 brief #4 — body parser limitation):**
// Compile-time E-ENGINE-INVALID-TRANSITION for direct writes inside
// state-child bodies (`<Small>{@marioState = .Cape}` when `.Cape ∉
// .Small.rule`) requires the body to be walkable AST. Today the body is
// raw text. Once the parser elevates state-child bodies to walkable
// nodes, the same PASS 11 walker can dispatch on the engine variable's
// `_resolvedStateCell` annotation inside each body. See progress.md
// "DEFERRED ITEMS".
//
// Reusability: B15 READS B14's `engineMeta` to perform validation. B15
// does extend `engineMeta.variants` + `engineMeta.stateChildren` (the
// only annotations B15 owns); does NOT mutate B14's other fields.

 * non-field cells (top-level decls with no parent compound), for compound
 * parents (whose synth lives at the compound level — use `getSynthRecords`
 * instead), or for `null` input.
 *
 * The returned array preserves declaration order (per
 * `PER_FIELD_SYNTH_PROPERTIES`): `[isValid, errors, touched]`. Per §55.6 +
 * §55.7 line 24468 — `submitted` is COMPOUND-LEVEL ONLY and is never
 * registered at per-field scope.
 *
 * Compound-typed children (e.g., `<form><address>...</></>` — `address` is
 * a child of `form` AND a compound parent) do NOT get duplicate per-field
 * records — `getPerFieldSynthRecords(addressDecl)` returns `[]`. The
 * compound-level synth on `address`'s compound-scope is the canonical
 * surface for that field path; consumers should use `getSynthRecords` on
 * the same decl for that case (the function correctly handles the
 * compound-typed case because B12 deliberately skips per-field
 * registration on compound-typed children — see `registerPerFieldSynthSurface`).
