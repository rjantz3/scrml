## BIG DECISIONS RATIFIED THIS SESSION

### S65 second tranche — Path A LOCKED + type-as-argument family roadmap (architectural commit)

After debate-05's narrowing of Bryan's lean from full Approach A to C-narrow, Bryan asked the load-bearing question: **"what future shippable features could ride the type-as-argument precedent?"** PA enumerated a 5-7 member family (parseVariant → serialize → formFor → schemaFor → tableFor → variantNames + reflective metadata). Two members (`formFor` and `tableFor`) GENUINELY require type-as-argument as a structural language concept — they cannot be expressed as desugars because the compiler must walk struct fields structurally to emit markup trees. **Bryan locked Path A.** Subsequent members ride the precedent for free.

**The deciding code sample (S65 internal — what locked the call):**

```scrml
type User:struct = {
    name:  string req length(>=2)
    email: string(email) req unique
    age:   int min(13) max(120)
}

<schema>${schemaFor(User)}</>
<users>: [User] = []

<program>
    <{formFor(User, submit=createUser)}/>
    <{tableFor(User, rows=@users)}/>
</>
```

One struct definition + five lines of glue → SQL schema with constraints, working form with validation/submission/errors, working table with rendered cells, full reactive lifecycle, zero npm packages. **scrml.dev flagship demo.**

**L22 phrasing (locked):** "Type-as-argument is a first-class scrml language primitive, introduced by `parseVariant`. Foundation for the type-as-argument family. Each future family member must independently pass per-shape sliver test + synonym-detection precondition + asymmetric-forfeit-cost decomposition."

**Discipline that bounds the family** (recorded in SCOPE doc + carried forward in family-precedent doc per Step 12): per-shape sliver test mandatory; synonym-detection mandatory; per-feature deep-dive when convener has any doubt. Without this discipline, Path A becomes the slippery slope simplicity-defender warned about. With it, Path A is load-bearing infrastructure for a 5-7 member family.

**Family economics:** ~20-30h architectural commit at parseVariant pays for ~85-145h of family-feature surface across 6-12 months.

### Boundary-parsing primitive — debate-05 verdict (5/5 unanimous C-narrow)

Convener: **Bryan strongly leaned yes** (anti-sycophancy stance — fired debate to test the lean). Verdict: **lean validated but narrowed** from full Approach A to C-narrow.

**Ship `parseVariant(json, EnumType)`. Close `parseShape` as intentional absent.**

Constraints (load-bearing — judge-ratified):
1. Second arg MUST be scrml-native `enum` type descriptor (not struct, not arbitrary type literal)
2. Discriminator key = enum's own variant names; no custom field name; no name-mapping table
3. Returns typed enum value or fails with `::ParseError msg`
4. Companion design statement closing `parseShape` ships with the addition

**Why not `parseShape`?** It's a synonym for §53 SPARK boundary-zone refinement on assignment. The synonym-detection test (debate-04 methodology) demoted it. Adding it would be stdlib bloat with no distinct semantic shape.

**Why `parseVariant`?** It's the type-establishment step for sum types — constructor selection from a discriminator field is what predicate systems can't perform. SPARK is the predicate-enforcement step that fires AFTER type-establishment. They're sequentially ordered, not substitutable. The DON'T-SHIP forfeit is paid on every tRPC integration in user code, forever.

### Pro-X-voice-voting-against-X at frequency-3 (methodology-grade signal)

| Debate | Expert | Default | Vote | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| debate-03 | roc-expert | retain component-overload carve-out | retracted | structural-element reframe |
| debate-04 | crystal-multi-dispatch | sanction switch as Tier 0+ | voted A (hard-error) | synonym-not-sliver |
| **debate-05** | **simplicity-defender** | **refuse stdlib expansion (B)** | **C-narrow** | **synonym test on `parseVariant`** |

Frequency-3 confirms: when a partisan-defender voice flips under its own methodology lens, the rejection is structurally stronger than expected agreement.

## DESIGN-INSIGHT contributions this session

### Insight #4 (debate-05): "Type-establishment vs predicate-enforcement are sequentially ordered, not substitutable"

When a language has a type-enforcement mechanism that operates on already-typed values (scrml's §53 SPARK three-zone enforcement), a natural assumption is that "parse unknown external data into a typed value" is covered by that mechanism. **It is not — these are sequentially ordered operations.** The type-establishment step (constructor selection from a discriminator) must happen *before* predicate enforcement can fire. A stdlib designed to replace an external parsing library must decompose into both steps. A language designer who provides only the second forces every developer to hand-roll the first forever.

The further refinement: the decomposition is type-specific. **For sum types** (enums, discriminated unions), the type-establishment step requires constructor selection — a closed, compiler-derivable operation that predicate systems cannot perform. **For product types** (structs), the type-establishment step collapses into "assign the fields," which a sound boundary-enforcement system already does. The stdlib primitive is justified for the sum-type case and is a synonym (bloat risk) for the product-type case.

The sliver test for any boundary-parsing primitive: **does this type's type-establishment step require operations that the language's predicate-enforcement mechanism cannot perform?** For sum types in a nominally-typed language: reliably yes. For product types under sound boundary enforcement: reliably no.

## A+ verdict execution carry-forward (from S64 — STILL pending)

These three items from debate-04 verdict have NOT yet been implemented (carried from S64 hand-off):

1. **`did-you-mean: match` quickfix on E-SWITCH-FORBIDDEN** — ~1-2h
2. **W-LIFECYCLE-CANDIDATE tightening** on `if=` over enum-tag-shaped string-literal RHS — ~1h
3. **Document JS-style `match expr {}` form as canonical value-return rung** in primer §1 + tier-ladder-promotion article — small

Combined: ~3-5h dispatch. Could fold into B3 or parseVariant work.

---

## Open questions to surface immediately at S66 open (UPDATED post-second-tranche)

1. **parseVariant Path A — RESOLVED.** Path A is locked (S65 second tranche). Survey-first diagnostic dispatch is in flight; will land before any implementation work. Open question NEXT: based on survey findings, fire the implementation dispatch (~20-30h Path A scope, possibly discounted via depth-of-survey) — OR refine SCOPE based on survey before dispatching.

2. **Dispatch sequencing post-survey:**
   - (a) Fire parseVariant Path A implementation (20-30h, possibly discounted)
   - (b) Fire B3 (`@name` resolution) first per S64 plan; parseVariant after
   - (c) Stack both — parseVariant Path A in background, B3 in foreground (no file overlap; should be safe)

3. **X-snippet selection.** 3 variants drafted at `docs/articles/x-snippet-zod-calibration-2026-05-06.md`. PA lean: variant 3 (long-form ~180 words) for credibility. Bryan to pick. Will surface again after survey lands.

4. **Companion follow-up dev.to article?** Variant 3 of X snippet narrates the debate-and-revise process. Optional follow-up article (`scrml-debate-amends-zod-claim-devto-2026-05-06.md`) could expand it. PA's view: skip — the npm-myth amendment + X post is sufficient. Avoid article-tail bloat.

5. **B3 dispatch readiness** — UNCHANGED from S64. `@name` resolution remains queued; no file conflicts with parseVariant work. 4-6h focused estimate (likely smaller).

6. **A+ verdict execution items** — UNCHANGED from S64 carry-forward. Could fold into next dispatch.

7. **Predicate-gaps inventory P-promotion** — under the Zod lens (deep-dive), 4 gaps promote to P1: `#17 transform/preprocess`, `#9 reqIf`, `#12 async predicates`, `#8 predicate aliases`. 3 new gaps surfaced (#18 named-shape breadth, #19 boundary-parsing — closing via parseVariant, #20 validator-set transform operators). Inventory revisit when A1c surfaces real-app friction OR adopter reports `reqIf` blocker.

8. **Carry-forward S62/S63/S64 unresolved set:**
   - Article truthfulness audit dispositions (15 articles, S59 carry-forward)
   - scrml.dev v0.2.0 announce refresh
   - 6 KEEP-RECENT-LANDED dirs deref (now eligible after large S64+S65)
   - Maps refresh root cause investigation (S61 issue still open)
   - Tier-ladder em-dashes decision

## Things S66 PA needs to NOT screw up

Standing list 1-47 from S64 hand-off carries forward verbatim. New S65 additions:

48. **`parseVariant` is the verdict-locked answer for sum-type boundary parsing.** Don't let any agent re-frame it as `parseShape`-equivalent or extend its scope to structs. The synonym test demoted `parseShape` for a reason; that decision is locked.

49. **`parseShape` is CLOSED as intentional absent** — by debate-05 verdict + judge ratification. Struct boundary parsing is a server function or §53 boundary-zone refinement on assignment. Don't accept "but `parseShape` would be ergonomic" as a re-open argument. The companion design statement must ship with the parseVariant implementation.

50. **Type-establishment-vs-predicate-enforcement is sequentially ordered.** SPARK boundary-zone refinement fires AFTER the value has a type. `parseVariant` is the operation that gives the value a type. Anyone proposing "just use refinement at the call site" for unknown JSON is missing the sequencing.

51. **String-discriminator trap mitigation = enum-only second-arg constraint at the type system.** Not a documentation concern; a compiler-enforced rule. `parseVariant(json, MyStruct)` must produce a clear "must be enum" compile error.

52. **Pro-X-voice-voting-against-X is methodology-grade signal at frequency-3.** Apply going forward: when a partisan-defender flips under its own methodology, weight the flip heavily.

53. **Article amendment posture is calibrated, not retracted.** Form-validation claim ("Zod can't fail your build. This can.") is unmodified — it survives every test. The boundary-parsing claim was overreach in absolute form ("None of it. Ever.") and is now narrowed. Don't let any agent further-soften the form-DX claim.

54. **The deep-dive's 17-gap predicate inventory was re-prioritized under the Zod lens.** P1 promotions: #8 (aliases), #9 (reqIf), #12 (async), #17 (transform/preprocess). Demoted to elimination: #1 (between), #2 (nonempty) — synonyms. Don't re-introduce demoted items under different names without sliver-test verification.

55. **L22 type-as-argument is LOCKED at the language level (S65 second tranche).** parseVariant is the FIRST family member; do NOT let any agent treat it as a one-off when planning implementation. SCOPE doc records the family roadmap; future PA's see L22 in master-list locks list.

56. **The family-bounding discipline is mandatory.** Sliver test + synonym-detection + per-feature deep-dive on every future `Type.foo` request. Without this, L22 becomes the slippery slope simplicity-defender warned about. The family-precedent doc (Step 12 of SCOPE) records this discipline; it MUST be written when parseVariant ships.

57. **`formFor` is the flagship demo.** The 1-struct → schema + form + table demo is the strongest "we are not React" pitch scrml has. PA dispatching `formFor` work later: treat it as marketing-load-bearing, not just stdlib expansion.
