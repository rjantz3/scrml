# scrml — Session 206 (OPEN)

**Date:** 2026-06-18. **Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-210.md` (S205 CLOSE). **Next pickup:** rotate THIS → `handOffs/hand-off-211.md` at OPEN. **Profile:** A — FULL (digest-thinned boot; full PRIMER/SPEC-INDEX cold reads DEFERRED pending session direction — read SPEC sections on demand per Rule 4). **Deputy:** worktree present (`../scrml-deputy-maint` @ deputy-maint, fully merged `^main==0`); liveness of the cron loop `39fed15c` not re-confirmed at boot.

> **Thinned wrap (S42 re-scope S205).** Mechanical state lives in: `bun scripts/state.ts` + `handOffs/digest.md` (board/counts/version/maps) · `handOffs/delta-log.md` (in-flight/landings/rulings) · `handOffs/deputy-state.md` (deputy + F3 watch). This hand-off carries only the irreducible.

## Boot state (S206 OPEN)
- Digest **CURRENT** (stamp 74d7d0e2) → board trusted: **HIGH 0 · MED 10 · LOW 23 · Nominal 8**, v0.7.0, subset 17161/90/0, maps 4 behind HEAD (492b4bb9 vs 9f203d82).
- Git: main `9f203d82`, origin **0/0**, `deputy-maint ^main == 0`. Inbox **empty**. scrml-support sync: not yet checked at OPEN.
- Untracked `handOffs/hand-off-209.md` (S204 close, rotated S205-OPEN, never committed) — git-add at next commit.

## ⏭️ OPEN THREADS

### 1. ✅ LANDED the 3 deferred F3-bridged agents (S206) — push HELD per user
All 3 branched off the S205 **session-start** base (`feedback_worktree_base_session_start_staleness`), reconciled at landing. Coherence 0/3, no leak.
- **g-colon-shorthand** `e2516298` — clean file-delta block-splitter.js + test; targeted gap flip → resolved. Rule-4 verified §4.14:986/:990.
- **g-engine-autodecl** `105f1ee4` — cherry-pick `d9ef8ee3` (clean auto-merge, non-overlapping w/ match-alt's type-system.ts); targeted gap flip → resolved. S138 dual-verify: comparison-in-return probe clean post-fix / `E-VARIANT-AMBIGUOUS` pre-fix.
- **trucking slice-2** `e1c20e3a` — reconciled via `git merge main` into the branch (3 slice-3 overlaps, conflict-free); merged app EXIT 0 baseline-preserved; file-delta 7 forms + progress; within-node allowlist re-baselined (6 fixtures, gate 1012/0); NEW gap filed (below).
- **NEW gap (slice-2 todo b):** `g-compound-field-render-by-tag-unexpanded` (MED, open) — Shape-2 field that's a CHILD of a Variant-C compound doesn't expand its render-by-tag `<field/>`; silently emits literal `<field />` (no input, no diagnostic). Top-level Shape-2 works. Durable repro `docs/changes/g-compound-field-render-by-tag-unexpanded-2026-06-18/repro/`. Workaround: raw `bind:value=@compound.field`.

All 3 LANDED + PUSHED (origin `359a1d83`); full suite 24463/0. Board HIGH 0 · MED 9 · LOW 23.

### 2. ⭐ flograph / block-lease "safe parallel same-file dispatch" arc (the S206 design thread — at a decision point)
User goal: "get flograph to the point of being able to launch parallel disps affecting the same file safely." Built + proven this session (all pushed):
- **(a) the block-scope INTERIM** (`scripts/dock.ts` `1b15f701`): `dock --units <file>` (enumerate leasable blocks w/ thin extents, lang-aware scrml+TS) + `dock --diff-scope <range> --owns id,…` (post-landing containment check, exit 1 on stray). **Dog-fooded:** code-def overlap (`type-system.ts` g-engine vs match-alt) PROVABLY DISJOINT → **code-def parallel dispatch is now enforceable**; markup overlap (`messages.scrml`) FALSE-collides (render-markup sits in no named def). block-lease DD §7.1.
- **(b1) anchoring PROVEN for named defs** (`10255c94` + DD §7.2): Scheme-C carried-comment survives rename/move; the dropped-anchor failure is caught by the inv3 orphan WARN. → block-lease-for-CODE no longer blocked on anchoring, only the BUILD (registry/lifecycle/blast-region = flogence-in-scrml).
- **(b2) markup-anchor DD DONE** (`scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/markup-lease-anchor-2026-06-18.md`, pushed): user REJECTED b2-ii componentize-to-lease (**co-location-of-behaviour axiom** + no-refactor-tax, user-voice S206 + memory `feedback_colocation_of_behaviour_axiom`). DD verdict: the **state-keyed seed** (lease a region by the reactive STATE it touches, not its structure) VALIDATES on the real case w/ zero file change; **D (state-footprint) vs G (hybrid+escalation)** survive every constraint (0/8 dev-polls favor prior A/B/C). **Two breaks:** BREAK-1 (compound `@form`→cell-grain needs DOTTED-PATH footprints; **PA-verified the DG is ROOT-CELL today** at `body-dg-builder.ts:399` → dotted-path write-tracking is a BUILD PREREQ for both D+G, feasible) · BREAK-2 (transitive-write hazard = the D/G differentiator). Feeds a DEBATE.
- **DECISION PENDING:** run the **D-vs-G debate** (becomes the dPA's first batch — see thread 2b) / **spike the dotted-path DG extension** first (common prereq, grounds BREAK-1) / continue.

### 2b. ⭐ Satellite-session architecture (dPA + CC-to-vPA) — 2 DDs done, ratification PENDING
The context-economics thread's conclusion: "the PA holds only what needs full scrml context; everything else gets a context-scoped SATELLITE." vPA-deputy = maintenance satellite; **dPA = deliberation-research satellite** (owns banked debates + DDs).
- **dPA DD DONE** (`scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/dpa-deliberation-satellite-2026-06-18.md`, `eb7a216`). Fork-1 VERIFIED via claude-code-guide: global `~/.claude/agents/` loads EVERY session regardless of cwd; project-local `<dir>/.claude/agents/` loads ONLY for sessions rooted there; no settings-key scope → **roster goes in `flogence/.claude/agents/`** (realizable exactly, the user's idea works). **Immediate de-bloat win:** ~8 debate/DD experts sit in global NOW, bloating every scrml PA boot → relocating them is the cheap first action. Boundary: **axiom-level Qs can't offload** (framing IS the deliberation) → stay inline; D-vs-G is offload-safe. dPA RUNS-not-RATIFIES (advisory artifacts; PA+user ratify). Honest savings: PA-window win (boot de-bloat + episodic offload), not total-token.
- **9-item ratification (§10)** to stand it up = ONE architecture decomposed: 3-role model · roster in flogence/.claude/agents + relocate 8 experts (keep scrml-deep-dive + thin inline roster) · forge-researches/dPA-authors-direct · `handOffs/dpa-queue.md` ledger + `(dpa:)` breadcrumbs · author `dpa-scrml.md` + `scrml/dpa.md` stub · digest `dpa-queue:` field · orchestrate-not-subsume + on-demand-batch · RUN-not-RATIFY boundary · offload-safe-vs-inline classification.
- **CANDIDATE banked (CC-to-vPA, user "just a thought"):** CC user-prompts to the vPA via **transcript-tail** (~free) → (1) vPA does mechanical user-voice capture (PA curates the durable axioms) + (2) vPA as a context **INDEX/ROUTER** (returns a POINTER to the source, NOT a cached answer — dodges the cheap-reset + asserted-not-verified tensions). Extends the PA↔vPA-comms-protocol DD (`pa-vpa-communication-protocol-2026-06-18.md`). Fold in WITH the dPA stand-up (both are satellite-protocol).
- **BOOTSTRAP:** this dPA DD is the LAST DD the PA runs INLINE; once stood up, the dPA owns DDs/debates. First dPA batch = D-vs-G.

### 3. Carried (board / other arcs)
- Open MEDs: g-shorthand-interp-engine-element-loci · g-engine-server-flag-silent-swallow (entangled w/ E-leg) · g-tier1-ssr-prerender · r28-c2 · a5 · bug-1 · bug-14 · **g-compound-field-render-by-tag-unexpanded** (NEW S206). e2e LOW residue: g-reflect-variant-shape · g-rendermap-server-classification · g-mount-hang-rails · meta-in-component-001.
- Trucking slices: slice-2 LANDED → slice-4 (errors-as-states, 148 `?{}` / 0 `!{}` — biggest idiom gap) → slice-5 (typed props, mostly verification).

### 4. Worktree cleanup (6b owed — ALL 5 agent worktrees now landed → removable)
All 5 S205 agent worktrees are landed (slice-3 a3a475 · match-alt a634857 · g-colon ab4fe40 · g-engine af5ed82 · slice-2 aeca436) → all removable at wrap. NEVER remove `../scrml-deputy-maint` (persistent deputy).
