# scrmlTS — Session 99 (CLOSE)

**Date:** 2026-05-17
**Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-100.md` (S98 CLOSE — comprehensive landing summary)
**Machine:** B (the `bryan-maclee` filesystem; orchestrator role this session was the OTHER machine, "Machine A" on the `bryan` filesystem)

---

## TL;DR for S100 PA pickup

S99 was a **two-track parallel session** — Machine A (the other machine, on `bryan` filesystem) ran the compiler-fix arc + B1 §51.0.B.1 wiring + corpus-refresh + twitter-archive drop + S99 LIVE hand-off rotation. This machine (Machine B per current labeling, on `bryan-maclee` filesystem) ran the voice-author article-assembly + twitter corpus extraction (507 candidates) + 9-page Day-30 reference build-out batch.

**Combined session output:** ~30 commits across both repos. v0.3.x patch arc continues; bug-k pre-push failure remains pre-existing orthogonal noise (1 fail consistent since S98).

**3 distinct gaps surfaced during S99 docs-build-out review:** dev-server URL routing, shell composition, Tailwind engine coverage. Bug report filed back to Machine A at `handOffs/incoming/2026-05-17-1815-machine-B-to-machine-A-dev-server-routing-bug.md` with 3 fix-shape options per gap + PA recommendation. v0.3.x candidate.

## Final state at S99 close

- **scrmlTS HEAD:** `83a902e` (feat(website): Day-30 reference build-out batch 3 — onTransition + page + schema + landing update)
- **scrml-support HEAD:** `1527d42` (scripts: promote twitter-archive extractor + regen candidates metadata)
- **Working tree:** clean both repos pre-wrap (verified at wrap start)
- **Worktrees:** only main on this machine — zero agent worktrees retained (all S99 work was direct-PA + Machine A's worktrees live on the other filesystem)

**Tests at HEAD `83a902e` (post-wrap full suite):** **15325 pass / 129 skip / 1 todo / 1 fail / 685 files / 44181 expect**.

The 1 fail is `compiler/tests/unit/bug-k-sync-effect-throw.test.js` — **pre-existing orthogonal**, same 1-fail count since S98 CLOSE. Authorized `--no-verify` pushes throughout S99 per user direction. Not caused by S99 work.

## S99 substantive deliverables

### Voice-author work (this machine)

1. **State-vs-logic axiom essay working-draft assembled** at `scrml-support/voice/articles/state-vs-logic-axiom-evolution-arc-DRAFT-2026-05-17.md`. User's S98 bridge-Q1 prose preserved verbatim; quotes inserted at user-marked `<insert qt>` placeholders; Quote 3 swapped from S95 shoot-straight (now reserved for building-anyway essay per cross-essay coordination) → GingerBill twitter reply 2026-05-15 (same controversy-drives-evolution thesis, public attestation). Quote 2 extended to include "When I reread what I originally typed, its totally not what I meant" sentence.

2. **Twitter archive corpus extraction** at `scrml-support/voice/twitter-corpus-candidates-2026-05-17.json` — **507 candidates** (451 tweets + 56 note-tweets) from 21.2 MB archive. Schema-compatible with `machine-A-corpus-candidates-2026-05-17.json` (425 Claude-transcript candidates from other machine) and `machine-B-corpus-candidates-2026-05-17.json` (645 Claude-transcript candidates from this machine S98B). **Total candidate pool now 1,577 across 3 streams** awaiting user-review-curation into `quote-library.json`.

3. **Extractor script promoted** to `scrml-support/scripts/regen-twitter-corpus-candidates.py` — parameterized, auto-discovers newest `twitter-archive-*.zip` in `voice/corpus-sources/`. Companion to other machine's `regen-corpus-candidates.py` (Claude-transcript source). Both follow same JSON output shape.

### Website reference build-out (this machine)

**Day-30 surface: 11 of ~22 element + context pages shipped.** Half the structural surface complete.

| Category | Shipped (S99 + prior) | Queued |
|---|---|---|
| **Elements** | 9: engine, errors, match, program, channel, auth, onTransition, page, schema | onTimeout, onIdle |
| **Contexts** | 2: logic, sql | `#{}` CSS, `^{}` meta, `_{}` foreign |
| **Keywords** | 0 | fn, lift, lin, pinned, derived, is, not, req, pure, ~, reset (~11 pages) |
| **Error codes** | 0 | ~30 most-common per-code pages |

All 9 element + 2 context pages follow the established 8-section template (header / syntax / worked example / semantics + errors / edge cases / related features / availability / specification).

**Authoring conventions captured for future feature pages:**
- HTML-entity escape `{` `}` inside all `<code>` and `<pre>` blocks containing `${...}` or unbalanced braces
- Escape `//` → `&#47;&#47;` inside inline `<code>` (parser otherwise consumes the closing tag as comment)
- Escape `/*` `*/` slashes in display code as `&#47;` for same reason
- File-top comments: avoid raw `<X attr="...">` tag shapes
- Avoid `&lt;X&gt;'s` apostrophe-s in body text — rephrase
- Bare `/` between tags / in `<td>` content parses as a closer — escape as `&#47;`
- Avoid raw `match <ident>` in markup text — escape with `&#109;atch` or rephrase

### Bugs filed / processed during S99

4. **Dev-server multi-page-app routing + shell-composition + Tailwind-engine gaps** — 3 distinct gaps filed in single bug report at `handOffs/incoming/2026-05-17-1815-machine-B-to-machine-A-dev-server-routing-bug.md`. Workarounds applied this session (hard-coded `/pages/` prefixes in 16 .scrml files; Tailwind Play CDN injection script for dist HTMLs). Proper fixes are v0.3.x compiler/dev-server work.

5. **bug-k-sync-effect-throw orthogonal failure** — same 1-fail count since S98 close; authorized `--no-verify` push throughout S99 per user direction. Surfaced per S88 protocol. Investigation candidate.

## In-flight / open questions for S100 PA pickup

### Immediate (carry-forward)

1. **Continue Day-30 reference build-out.** Remaining ~22-30 pages: `<onTimeout>` + `<onIdle>` (closes elements); `#{}` + `^{}` + `_{}` contexts; ~11 keyword pages; ~30 error code pages. Each follows the 8-section template + the authoring conventions above. Pacing: ~3 pages per dispatch batch is a sustainable cadence.

2. **bug-k-sync-effect-throw investigation.** Pre-existing orthogonal failure blocking the pre-push gate. ~1-2h dispatch candidate. Until closed, every push needs `--no-verify` + explicit authorization.

3. **Dev-server routing bug pickup by Machine A.** The 1815-MB-to-MA bug report sits in `handOffs/incoming/`. Machine A's next session should action — pick a fix shape (PA recommended Option C: emit `dist/<route>.html` directly with shell inlined) + dispatch.

### User-driven (waiting for direction)

4. **lin redesign Phase 1** (#4 from S98) — user paused S98 ("I'll think about lin"). Status unchanged this session.

5. **Typestate-primitive meta-shape** (#12 from S98) — design horizon stub at `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/typestate-primitive-meta-shape-design-horizon-2026-05-17.md`. Default hold.

6. **Voice corpus curation pass.** 1,577 candidates across 3 streams. User selectively promotes to canonical `quote-library.json`.

7. **State-vs-logic essay finalization.** Working-draft has user's bridge-Q1 prose + 3 quotes + user's "I would" lead-in for closing. User authors final prose; PA's role is substrate supply per S95 voice-author redesign.

### v0.3.x / v0.5+ backlog (unchanged from S98)

8. **CG hotspot deep characterization** (#18) — v0.5+ horizon.
9. **BS-level `/* */` bug** (#23) — sub-anomaly from S98 A1 fix; v0.3.x backlog.

## Things S100 PA must NOT screw up

### Permanently load-bearing (from prior sessions)

- pa.md Rules 1-5 (no marketing without prompt; full-production fidelity; right beats easy; SPEC normative; shoot straight)
- All S96-S99 PA-memory rules in `~/.claude/projects/-home-bryan-maclee-scrmlMaster-scrmlTS/memory/`
- Cross-machine sync hygiene — fetch/pull both repos at session start (S43)
- S83 commit discipline two-sided rule
- S88 isolation:worktree mandatory on every dev-agent Agent() call + `--no-verify` requires explicit user authorization
- S91 CWD-routing rule
- S95 communication norms (shoot straight; politeness for politeness sake rejected)
- S96 SPEC-at-session-start
- S98 Pillar 5b "Reach discipline"

### S99 NEW (carried into S100)

- **Reuse-over-reinvent for voice work** — if user has already said something well, surface it from the substrate (quote-library / corpus-candidates / tweet-drafts / prior articles) before generating new prose. User-voice S99 verbatim: "If I have already said something well once, why come up with it again."
- **Cross-essay quote-overstacking is signal** — when two scaffolds claim the same quote, surface a sibling-quote swap (S99 GingerBill-tweet swap is the canonical pattern).
- **Visit-and-verify is part of the docs-build-out loop.** Compiling-in-isolation doesn't validate the site as a whole. Future build-out passes should include browser-visit-and-click-through before declaring shippable.
- **`--no-verify` authorization scope is per-session.** S99 authorized for S99 pushes only; S100 needs fresh authorization until bug-k closes.
