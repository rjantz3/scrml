## Summary

Total docs scanned: ~98 `.md` files (excluding node_modules, .git, .jj, .claude,
  archive, handOffs, dist/build/target). docs/changes/ counted in aggregate.
Compliant (mapped or out-of-scope reference): ~14
Non-compliant: 5 categories (1 large aggregate + 4 named)
Uncertain: 3

SPEC.md modification watermark: 2026-05-21 20:16 (current). Docs older than this
that describe non-trivial aspirational state are flagged below. The 67a17dc5→
26e82466 range added only per-dispatch progress files under docs/changes/ and
session bookkeeping (changelog.md, master-list.md, PA-SCRML-PRIMER.md) — no NEW
non-compliance category. The categories below are unchanged from the prior scan;
counts refreshed.

## Non-compliant docs

### docs/changes/** (178 files across ~80+ directories)
**Reason:** location + name-heuristic (combo)
**Detail:** Every directory under `docs/changes/` is a per-dispatch artifact set
— `BRIEF.md`, `SCOPE.md`, `progress.md` for completed or in-flight work. The
S118 M5-swap range added 13 progress/brief files to
`docs/changes/m5-v0.5-compressed-ladder/` (progress-A2/B1-B2-B3-B7/B4-B5-B6/R1/
R4, BRIEF-R1/R2/R4, etc.) — historical dispatch records, not current reference
docs. The repo already acknowledges this:
`docs/curation/2026-05-05-changes-dir-disposition.md` is a standing curation
matrix dispositioning these dirs to `scrml-support/archive/dispatches/`.
**Suggested disposition:** deref completed-arc dirs to scrml-support/archive/dispatches/;
keep only actively-in-flight dirs (per the curation matrix). The
`m5-v0.5-compressed-ladder/` dir is the IN-FLIGHT M5-swap arc (C1 dispatch pending)
and should STAY until M6 closes.

### docs/website/roadmap-from-v0.3-2026-05-14.md
**Reason:** content-heuristic + name-heuristic
**Detail:** Front-matter `status: draft`; adopter-facing roadmap describing where
the compiler is "going" from v0.3 — aspirational by definition. Predates the
current SPEC; package.json is now v0.6.0.
**Suggested disposition:** deref to scrml-support/docs/ (roadmap/planning content
belongs in support, not the project repo per the "current truth only" principle).

### docs/website/v0.2.0-announce-2026-05-05.md  and  docs/website/v0.3.0-announce-2026-05-14.md
**Reason:** location + currency
**Detail:** Version-announcement marketing copy. Not reference docs for dev
agents; describe release-moment nominal state, not current code. Both are for
superseded releases (package.json is at 0.6.0).
**Suggested disposition:** deref both to scrml-support/docs/ (or archive the
v0.2.0 one). Not load-bearing for any dev-agent navigation.

### docs/audits/** (11 audit docs)
**Reason:** location
**Detail:** article-truthfulness-audit, compiler-forgotten-surface, null-audit,
undefined-audit, wave-3-7-corpus-ouroboros, self-host-spec-conformance,
articles-currency-table, happy-dom-perf-regression, scrml-dev-content-spec-
fidelity, scrml-support-currency-sweep, scope-c-findings-tracker. Audit reports
are point-in-time investigation artifacts — they belong in scrml-support per the
"deep-dives / audits live in scrml-support" rule. Several are dated 30+ days
before the current SPEC (compiler-forgotten-surface 2026-05-06).
**Suggested disposition:** deref to scrml-support/docs/ (or scrml-support/archive/).
scope-c-findings-tracker.md may still be live — see Uncertain below.

### docs/curation/2026-05-05-changes-dir-disposition.md
**Reason:** location + currency
**Detail:** A curation matrix (S61) for the docs/changes/ deref. Its own snapshot
("103 dirs total") is stale — docs/changes/ now has 178 tracked files. It is a
process artifact, not a reference doc.
**Suggested disposition:** deref to scrml-support/docs/ once the docs/changes/
deref above is executed; or update the count and keep as the standing checklist.

## Uncertain docs (needs human review)

### docs/known-gaps.md
**Reason:** This doc EXPLICITLY catalogs spec-vs-implementation drift — by
construction it describes things the compiler does NOT do. That makes it look
non-compliant under the grep cross-check, but it is also the canonical,
intentionally-maintained drift ledger. It is genuinely useful to a dev agent.
**What to check:** Confirm with the user whether known-gaps.md should stay as a
project-repo reference (it is current-state-honest) or move to scrml-support.
Recommend KEEP — it is the opposite of aspirational-pretending-to-be-current.

### docs/pinned-discussions/w-program-001-warning-scope.md
**Reason:** "pinned discussion" — a discussion/debate-shaped doc, which the scope
rule says belongs in scrml-support. But "pinned" suggests it is an
intentionally-retained active design note.
**What to check:** Determine if the W-PROGRAM-001 scope question is resolved. If
resolved, deref to scrml-support/docs/. If still open, keep.

### docs/external-js.md  and  docs/lin.md
**Reason:** Reference-shaped docs (external-js integration; the `lin` token
feature) but not obviously cross-checked against current code.
**What to check:** Grep the identifiers each cites against compiler/src. Both
features resolve in source (`LinDeclNode` in ast.ts; `LinDecl` StmtKind in the
native parser as of B4; api.js handles .js imports) — recommend KEEP as current
reference pending a quick grep confirmation.

## Notes on compliant / in-scope docs (NOT flagged)
- compiler/SPEC.md, SPEC-INDEX.md, PIPELINE.md — authoritative spec; mapped.
  §58 Build Story is spec-ahead but explicitly self-labels as a "Nominal section"
  with a §58.12 gap enumeration — that is honest spec-ahead, NOT non-compliant.
- README.md, DESIGN.md, docs/tutorial.md, docs/changelog.md, scrmlFormula.md,
  docs/PA-SCRML-PRIMER.md — current reference; in-scope.
- compiler/native-parser/README.md, M5-ast-bridge-scoping.md,
  M5-divergence-ledger.md, M5-SWAP-residual-decomposition.md — current
  native-parser reference; LOAD-BEARING for the C1 dispatch; in-scope (they
  describe current state + scoped future work honestly).
- compiler/src/codegen/README.md, compiler/tests/.../REGISTRY.md — current
  module-local reference; in-scope.
