scrml's own language error model is values-not-exceptions (SPEC §19.1 — no try/catch, no throw).
The compiler itself surfaces structured CGError objects to the caller; it never throws on bad input.

## Error Class

### CGError  [compiler/src/codegen/errors.ts:11]
code: string; message: string; span: CGSpan | object; severity: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info'
- W-/I- prefix OR severity:warning/info → result.warnings (non-fatal, CLI exits 0)
- All other codes → result.errors (fatal, CLI exits 1)
- Cross-stream helper required when asserting on W-*/I-* codes in tests (see diagnostic-stream-partition memory note)

| E-SYNTAX-064 | 1 | **(S157 NEW/PROMOTED)** `@.` or `@.field` used outside an `<each>` body scope (§17.7.3). Fired at two sites: (1) TS markup-attr-value walk when `value.name` starts with `@.` and `!inEachBodyScope()` [type-system.ts:7434]; (2) TS `visitAttr` for variable-ref attr values [type-system.ts:6643].

## Key New / Changed Codes Since Watermark c665714c (S154-S158)

### S154 — #14 event-payload-transition (parser batch 1)
No new diagnostics; existing codes extended. `accepts=MsgType` is recorded verbatim on the AST; the typer batch 2 (S155) owns the resolution diagnostic.

### S155 — #14 event-payload-transition (typer batch 2 + codegen batch 3)
- **E-ENGINE-ACCEPTS-NOT-ENUM** — `accepts=MsgType` resolves to an unknown or non-`:enum` type. SYM PASS 11, symbol-table.ts. Fatal.
- **E-ENGINE-MSG-WITHOUT-ACCEPTS** — state-child has message arms but engine has no `accepts=`. SYM PASS 20, symbol-table.ts. Fatal.
- **E-ENGINE-MSG-ARM-NOT-EXHAUSTIVE** — message-arm set does not cover all `accepts=` enum variants and has no wildcard. SYM PASS 20, symbol-table.ts. Fatal.
- **E-ENGINE-MSG-UNKNOWN** — `.advance(.X)` variant is in neither the state-transition plane nor the message-dispatch plane. type-system.ts. Fatal.

### S156 — Bug 62 + (d)-A enum-subset (4 batches)
- **E-MATCH-SUBSET-DEAD-ARM** — dead arm inside a `<match>` on a subset-refined cell. Batch 2: type-system.ts (type-resolution path, both match loci). Batch 4: symbol-table.ts PASS 20 (string-based path, constructor-form + member-access). Both fire independently when the matched cell's type has `subsetVariants`. Fatal.
- **E-CONTRACT-002** (extended use) — enum-subset refinement error markers (range form, empty list, malformed entries) lower to E-CONTRACT-002 at declaration time via `checkEnumSubsetErrorMarkers()` in type-system.ts. Reuses the contract family rather than introducing a dedicated code.
- Bug 62 fix: NO new error code. The root cause was silent wrong-JS generation (`.advance(.X)` lowered without engine-ctx → stale JS); the fix is in emit-each.ts codegen path, not diagnostic emission.

### S157 — match-exhaustiveness arc + multi-bug pass
- **E-SYNTAX-064** (promoted from implicit to explicit) — `@.` contextual sigil outside an `<each>` body scope. Previously fell through to confusing E-SCOPE-001 (base-name `@` unresolved) or E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS (downstream JS parse failure). Now fires E-SYNTAX-064 explicitly at the TS pass (two sites in type-system.ts). Fatal.
- **Bug 70** (no new code) — E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS gate in api.js: suppressed when a prior fatal error already exists (`hasPriorFatalError` check). No new diagnostic; changes when the existing gate fires.
- **Bug 63** (no new code) — markup event-handler attribute `.advance(.V)` variant checking extended to use existing E-TYPE-063 (invalid variant in two-plane resolution). Same code family as the statement-path check.
- Bug 65/72/60/71/67 fixes: NO new error codes. Bug 65 = silent miscompile (fix is engine-ctx threading in emit-lift.js). Bug 72 = E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS (now prevented at codegen rather than detected post-emit). Bug 60 = missing render-by-tag expansion (no diagnostic path). Bug 71/67 = missing exhaustiveness (now correctly fires E-TYPE-020 via the existing match exhaustiveness path).

### S158 — Bug 64 / R28-1c per-item content reactivity + Bug 72 completion
- Bug 64/R28-1c: NO new error codes. The failure mode was stale content (no compiler error). Fix is purely codegen + runtime (EachReconcileCtx stack + _scrml_resolve_item).
- Bug 72 completion: see S157 — fully closed between S157 (ast-builder bare-@ branch) and the runtime-template / emit-each changes landing here.

## Fix Notes

### E-TYPE-001 dormancy (S151 C4 / R28-5)
Object-literal lifecycle contexts in `type-system.ts` were missing E-TYPE-001 emission paths.
Fixed in `type-system.ts` — object-literal construction now correctly triggers lifecycle type checks.

### Source-map line-lie (S149-S150)
Prior implementation emitted `0:0` stubs for all mappings (a lying synthetic source map).
S149 (B2): `build-source-map.ts` now uses `srcmap-provenance.ts` sentinel marks injected by
emit functions to record USE-SITE spans. `srcmapMark()` injects `#scrmlmap#` tokens; `buildSourceMap()`
scans them via `findSrcmapMarks()`, resolves to real source positions, and strips marks via
`stripSrcmapMarks()` before output.
S150 (line-lie close): honest-synthetic validation — synthetic mappings validated at resolution
time; map entries that cannot resolve to a real source line are marked synthetic in the output.

### Inline ?{} SQL CPS-split (S152)
`emit-control-flow.ts` — inline `?{}` SQL inside a conditional branch was not being CPS-split;
the branch body lacked the `await _scrml_sql...` wrapping IIFE. Fixed; coupled match-server-emit
path also corrected (match arms containing SQL on the server side).

### `<each>` render-before-cell-init crash (S152 HIGH)
`emit-each.ts` — `emitEachBodyRenderForFile()` emits a render fn that runs synchronously at
module-init. When the source cell is declared in the same file, `_scrml_reactive_set` runs
AFTER the render fn (module-init order). The bare `_scrml_reconcile_list(_mount, undefined, ...)`
threw `TypeError: ...newItems.length`. Fix: guard `if (!_items) { _mount.replaceChildren(); return; }`
before reconcile; `_scrml_effect_static` subscription re-runs the fn once cell-init fires.

### `<each>`-in-dynamic-context sweep (S153) — every place an `<each>` lives inside a dynamic mount

**engine-gated `<each>` never populates (54d54d4d, the req2 blocker)** — an `<each>` whose mount
lives in a non-`initial=` engine arm is absent from the DOM at module-init; the render hit
`if (!_mount) return;` BEFORE reading `@cell` → `_scrml_effect_static`'s one-shot dep pass recorded
no dependency → never re-fired. Three coupled codegen modes: (A) `emit-each.ts` reads `_items`
BEFORE the `!_mount` early-return (always tracks the dep); (B) `emit-variant-guard.ts` + runtime —
`_scrml_each_renderers` registry + `_scrml_remount_each(root)` helper the arm-swap dispatcher calls
after innerHTML+wire; (C) `emit-client.ts` `detectRuntimeChunks` descends into engine `bodyChildren`
(was tree-shaking the reconcile/effect chunks out → ReferenceError).

**`<each>` in a block-form `<match>` arm emits invalid JS (3429b385, was E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS)** —
match arms are raw text (`armsRaw`); `emit-match` re-parsed via `nativeParseFile` → a generic
`markup tag="each"`, NOT an `each-block` (the each-block transform lives in `buildAST`, not the
native parser) → rendered inline with `@.` unscoped (`.name` leak). Fix: each-bearing arms re-parse
via `splitBlocks`+`buildAST`; `restampEachBlockIds` namespaces ids; lifted each-blocks attach to
`matchBlock.bodyChildren` so `collectEachBlocks` emits the render fn with the `@.` rewrite;
`__scrmlCachedArms` memoizes across the two passes.

**`:`-shorthand child inside an engine arm breaks state-child parsing (c89c1cb1, was
E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-MISSING)** — a §4.14 `:`-shorthand child (`<li : @.name>`) inside an engine
state-child broke closer-pairing. Fix: attr-aware `isColonShorthandOpener` (whitespace-preceded
depth-0 non-string `:`; tracks string/paren/brace/bracket/`${}` so `bind:`/`on:`/`style="x:y"`/
`${a?b:c}` aren't mis-detected) wired into all 3 finders, mirroring the void/self-close exclusions.

**`<each>` over an enclosing-scope binding (e6870f25, was E-SCOPE-001 / E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS)** —
two bugs, one root (file-scope each emission can't see enclosing scope): (A) nested `<each>` (the
`as` pattern) — the inner each was lifted to module-scope reading `group.items` (undefined) →
ReferenceError; fix = inline emission in the outer factory via shared `emitEachReconcileLines`.
(B) `<each>` in a component body — `@.id` E-SCOPE-001 + `.name` leak; 3 roots in
`component-expander.ts` (native parser doesn't promote each/match → legacy `splitBlocks`+`buildAST`
re-parse fallback; `substituteProps` missed each-block string fields; tokenized `@ . id` collapse).

### Bug 62 — `<each>` engine-ctx threading (S156)
`emit-each.ts` — per-item event handlers in `<each>` templates that contained `.advance(.X)` or
`@engine = .X` were lowered WITHOUT engine awareness: `rewriteBlockBody` had no reference to the
file's engine metadata (the `EngineRewriteCtx`) so the call resolved to `undefined(...)` → silent
wrong JS. Fix: `buildEachEngineCtx(fileAST)` is called ONCE at the top of `emitEachBodyRenderForFile`,
collects all file-scope engines with message arms + their message-variant sets, builds a minimal
`EachEngineCtx` carrying the engine var names, a spread of `emitExprField` context extras, and the
`engineRewriteCtx`. This ctx is threaded through all `renderTemplateAttrToJs` / `renderTemplateChildToJs`
/ `emitEachReconcileLines` calls; `emitEngineHandlerBody(preRewritten, ctx)` intercepts (A) call-ref
`.advance(.X)` forms and (B) assign-ref `@engine = .X` forms and routes both to the correct plane.

### Bug 65 — `${for…lift}` engine-ctx threading (S157 — CLOSED)
`emit-lift.js` — the IDENTICAL gap as Bug 62 in the Tier-0 path. `buildLiftEngineCtx(fileAST)`
delegates to `buildEachEngineCtx` via `require()`. `buildLiftEngineCtxFromExtras(extras)` is a thin
re-pack adapter that uses engine extras already threaded via emit-logic opts (no AST re-walk).
`tryLowerLiftEngineHandler(rawHandlerText, engineCtx)` delegates to `emitEngineHandlerBody` (emit-each).
`emit-logic.ts` for-stmt case threads all engine extras (previously silently dropped) into `emitForStmt`.
The failure mode (pre-fix) was a SILENT miscompile: `_scrml_reactive_get("phase").advance("Active")`
→ `.advance` on a bare string → `TypeError` on click. `node --check` passed. `compileScrml()` exits 0.

### Bug 60 — render-by-tag nested compound field expansion (S157 — CLOSED)
`emit-html.ts` — `<signupForm><userName/></>` where `userName` is a field of a compound-parent
`signupForm` cell. Bare `lookupStateCell(tag)` returned undefined for the nested field because
compound-parent cells register their children under qualified paths (`signupForm.userName`), not
bare names. Fix: `enclosingCompoundStack: string[]` tracks the active compound wrapper tag during
the markup walk; fallback `lookupQualifiedStateCell(fileScope, [enclosing, tag])` resolves nested
fields. `dependency-graph.ts`: render-by-tag tag names (lowercase, matching `reactiveVarNodeIds`)
now credit the cell as a reader for E-DG-002 purposes.

### Bug 72 — nested `<each>` inside Tier-0 `${for…lift}` (S158 — CLOSED)
`emit-lift.js` + `ast-builder.js` — A `<each>` child of lifted markup arrives as generic `markup`
node (ast-builder's `parseLiftTag` never promotes to `each-block`). Pre-fix: rendered as literal
`<each>` DOM tag + inner `@.` leaked raw → E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS. Two parts:
(1) `ast-builder.js` `_parseLiftAttrValue`: bare `PUNCT "@"` token now collected as balanced
`@...` token run → `{kind:"expr"}` value; keeps the lift on the structured `{kind:"markup"}` path.
(2) `emit-lift.js` `tryEmitNestedLiftEach`: routes `{kind:"markup", tag:"each"}` child through
`emitNestedEachFromMarkup` (emit-each.ts) → inline reconcile JS. Inner `@.` correctly lowers to
the inner each's iter var (§17.7.3 innermost-scope-wins).

### Bug 64 / R28-1c — per-item content reactivity on reconcile (S158 — CLOSED)
`_scrml_reconcile_list` reuses DOM nodes for same-key items (B2 fast-path bail). Per-item TEXT
and class: bindings that closed over the create-time iter var showed STALE content on array-replace
/ reorder. Fix has three layers:
(1) **Runtime** (`runtime-template.js`): `_scrml_reconcile_list` builds `container._scrml_item_by_key`
key→item Map on every pass; calls `_scrml_trigger(container, "_scrml_items")` (skip first pass) to
re-fire per-item effects. `_scrml_resolve_item(container, key)` tracks `(container, "_scrml_items")`,
returns live item via `_scrml_deep_reactive` or `null`.
(2) **Tier-1** (`emit-each.ts`): `EachReconcileCtx` stack; `maybeWrapEachPerItemEffect(lines, iterVar, indent)`:
when a reconcile ctx is active for the iter var, wraps binding body in a `_scrml_effect` that
calls `_scrml_resolve_item` + null-guard before running the body.
(3) **Tier-0** (`emit-lift.js`, `emit-control-flow.ts`): `_scrml_lift_reconcile_ctx_stack` +
`pushLiftReconcileCtx`/`popLiftReconcileCtx` wired into the `for`-loop `createFn` body. Key
captured as `item?.id != null ? item.id : _scrml_idx` (mirrors `_scrml_reconcile_list` keyFn).
`maybeWrapLiftPerItemEffect` wraps per-item bindings identically. Both tiers end on ONE live-keyed
per-item binding shape.

### (d)-A enum-subset refinement (S156, 4 batches)
**Batch 1 (type-system.ts):** `parseEnumSubsetRefinement()` calls the shared `parseEnumSubsetAnnotation()`
from `enum-subset-refinement.ts`; `makeEnumSubsetPredicatedType()` materializes a `PredicatedType` with
`subsetVariants: Set<string>` (already complemented for `notIn`). Error markers (range form, empty set,
malformed entries) are deferred as `predicate.kind === "error"` and lowered to E-CONTRACT-002 at
declaration-site validation.

**Batch 2 (symbol-table.ts PASS 20 + type-system.ts match exhaustiveness):** Both match exhaustiveness
loci (block-form `<match>` in PASS 20; constructor-form + member-access in type-system.ts) now narrow
to the `subsetVariants` set instead of the full base-enum set. Arms naming excluded variants →
`E-MATCH-SUBSET-DEAD-ARM`; arms naming in-subset variants are required for exhaustiveness.

**Batch 3 (emit-predicates.ts + emit-schema-for.ts):** `predicateToJsExpr()` handles `kind: "variant-set"`:
emits `(["A","B"].includes(valueExpr))`; `classifyFieldForSql()` handles `predicated` type with
`subsetVariants`: emits `{ kind: "bare-enum", ..., enumSubset: true }` so the DDL walker emits
`CHECK (col IN ('Admin','Editor'))` in base-enum declaration order.

**Batch 4 (symbol-table.ts PASS 20 reach — constructor-form + member-access):** E-MATCH-SUBSET-DEAD-ARM
enforcement extended to the constructor-form match path and member-access match path in PASS 20,
so both `<match on=@role>` block-form AND inline `match @role { .Admin => ... }` patterns enforce
the subset. Closes Bug 66 (both loci must agree per §18.8.1 / §18.0.1).

## Error Handling Patterns
- All compile errors returned as CGError[] in result.errors or result.warnings
- Caller checks result.errors.length to determine if compilation succeeded
- No exceptions thrown for source-level errors; exceptions only for internal compiler bugs
- `compileScrml()` in api.js is the single error-surface boundary

## Global Error Boundaries
No client-level JS error boundaries in the compiler itself.
The emitted scrml app gets `errorBoundary` support via `emit-error-boundary.ts` (§19.6).
errorBoundary compile support: `compiler/src/codegen/emit-error-boundary.ts` (320L) — extracts
fallback markup + per-variant renders; paired with host-JS try/catch backstop (§19.6.8 C-hybrid).
