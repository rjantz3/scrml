scrml's own language error model is values-not-exceptions (SPEC §19.1 — no try/catch, no throw).
The compiler itself surfaces structured CGError objects to the caller; it never throws on bad input.

## Error Class

### CGError  [compiler/src/codegen/errors.ts:11]
code: string; message: string; span: CGSpan | object; severity: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info'
- W-/I- prefix OR severity:warning/info → result.warnings (non-fatal, CLI exits 0)
- All other codes → result.errors (fatal, CLI exits 1)
- Cross-stream helper required when asserting on W-*/I-* codes in tests (see diagnostic-stream-partition memory note)

## Error Code Families (374+ distinct codes in compiler source)

| Family | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| E-ATTR-* | ~15 | Attribute validation errors |
| E-AUTH-* | ~8 | Auth graph + role resolution errors |
| E-AUTH-GRAPH-* | 4 | Auth graph structural errors (E-AUTH-GRAPH-001..004) |
| E-BATCH-* | 2 | SQL batch planner errors |
| E-BS-* | 1 | Block-splitter sentinel (E-BS-000) |
| E-CG-* | ~15 | Code generator errors (E-CG-001..015) |
| E-CHANNEL-* | ~10 | Channel declaration errors |
| E-CLOSURE-* | 2 | Closure scope errors |
| E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS | 1 | Emitted-JS parse-gate invariant (default-ON, S142): emitted JS fails `node --check`. S153 closed two false-fire classes: `<each>` w/ `@.` sigil in a block-form `<match>` arm (3429b385) + `<each>` in a component body (e6870f25) — both previously leaked unscoped `.name` / `@ . id` into emitted JS |
| E-COMPONENT-* | ~15 | Component definition/usage errors |
| E-CONTRACT-* | 4 | Server-fn contract errors |
| E-CPS-* | 6 | CPS async planner errors (idempotency, multibatch reorder/machine-crossing) |
| E-CTRL-* | 6 | Control flow errors |
| E-CTX-* | 2 | Context errors (E-CTX-001: unclosed block; E-CTX-003: shorthand confusion) |
| E-DECL-NEEDS-INITIALIZER | 1 | (S152) — non-array typed-decl with no RHS; only `T[]` typed-array decls may omit RHS (default `[]` per §6.2 Shape 4) [ast-builder.js:4236] |
| E-DERIVED-* | 7 | Derived-value errors (circular-dep, engine-no-initial/rules/write, value-mutate) |
| E-DG-* | 2 | Dependency graph errors — E-DG-002 false-positive fix: credits lambda-body @var reads + `<match on=@cell>` block-form headers [dependency-graph.ts] |
| E-EACH-ITER-SHAPE | 1 | Each iteration shape errors: missing-or-both `of`/`in` attrs [ast-builder.js] |
| E-ENGINE-* | ~20 | Engine declaration errors (incl. E-ENGINE-010: `given` guard in type-level transitions block) |
| E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-MISSING | 1 | Engine state-child closer un-findable. S153 (c89c1cb1) closed the `:`-shorthand-child false-fire class: a `<tag : expr>` child inside an engine arm pushed a phantom unbalanced opener onto `lowerDepth` that absorbed the state-child `</>`. Fixed via attr-aware `isColonShorthandOpener` in all 3 closer-finders [engine-statechild-parser.ts] |
| E-ERRORS-* | 2 | `<errors>` element validation (E-ERRORS-001, E-ERRORS-002) |
| E-EXPR-* | 30 | Native-parser expression grammar codes (§34.1) |
| E-FORMFOR-* | 8 | formFor type validation errors |
| E-HISTORY-* | 1 | Engine history attribute error |

| E-LIFECYCLE-* | ~12 | Lifecycle hook errors |
| E-LIN-* | 2 | Linear-type errors |
| E-MATCH-* | ~6 | Pattern match errors (E-MATCH-ARM-SEPARATOR: stray-comma arm separator §18.2) |
| E-META-* | 7 | Meta check/eval errors |
| E-MW-* | ~6 | Middleware errors |
| E-NAME-* | 1 | Name collision with reserved identifier |
| E-PA-* | ~7 | protect-analyzer errors — E-PA-002 false-positive fix: `extractCreateTableStatements` now generic cycle-safe deep-walk; finds CREATE TABLE in `body`/`?{}` under fn-decl bodies + top-level `${}` logic blocks [protect-analyzer.ts] |
| E-PARSEVARIANT-* | ~3 | parseVariant API errors |
| E-REPLAY-* | 3 | Engine replay errors |
| E-RESET-* | 1 | Reset target errors |
| E-RI-* | ~3 | Route inference errors |
| E-SCOPE-001 | 1 | Identifier out of scope (e.g. `key=@.id` outside an each item scope). S153 (e6870f25) closed the `<each>`-in-component-body false-fire: `substituteProps` now covers each-block string fields so `@.id` resolves in the component-expanded body |
| E-SQL-* | ~8 | SQL context errors |
| E-STMT-* | 43 | Native-parser statement grammar codes (§34.1) |
| E-SWITCH-FORBIDDEN | 1 | `switch` keyword in scrml source |

## Key New / Changed Codes Since Watermark 09f74bee (S148-S153)

- E-DECL-NEEDS-INITIALIZER — S152 §6.2 Shape 4; fires when a non-array typed-cell decl has no RHS initializer; message includes the correct `<name>: T = ...` form as correction hint [ast-builder.js:4236]
- W-EACH-PROMOTABLE — S130 HU-1; info-level; `${ for (let x of @cell) { lift ... } }` is promotable to `<each>` tier-1 form; fired in Stage 6.4c lint pass [lint-w-each-promotable.js:205]
- W-EACH-KEY-001 — S130 HU-1; info-level; `<each in=@cell>` items have no inferable `.id` key; fired in Stage 6.4d lint pass [lint-w-each-key.js:210]
- NO new error codes in S153 — the sweep CLOSED false-fire classes on three existing codes (E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS, E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-MISSING, E-SCOPE-001); see Fix Notes below

## Fix Notes

### E-TYPE-001 dormancy (S151 C4 / R28-5)
Object-literal lifecycle contexts in `type-system.ts` were missing E-TYPE-001 emission paths.
Fixed in `type-system.ts` — object-literal construction now correctly triggers lifecycle type checks.

### Source-map line-lie (S149-S150)
Prior implementation emitted `0:0` stubs for all mappings (a lying synthetic source map).
S149 (B2): `build-source-map.ts` now uses `srcmap-provenance.ts` sentinel marks injected by
emit functions to record USE-SITE spans. `srcmapMark()` injects `#scrmlmap#` tokens; `buildSourceMap()`
scans them via `findSrcmapMarks()`, resolves to real source positions, and strips marks via
`stripSrcmapMarks()` before output.
S150 (line-lie close): honest-synthetic validation — synthetic mappings validated at resolution
time; map entries that cannot resolve to a real source line are marked synthetic in the output.

### Inline ?{} SQL CPS-split (S152)
`emit-control-flow.ts` — inline `?{}` SQL inside a conditional branch was not being CPS-split;
the branch body lacked the `await _scrml_sql...` wrapping IIFE. Fixed; coupled match-server-emit
path also corrected (match arms containing SQL on the server side).

### `<each>` render-before-cell-init crash (S152 HIGH)
`emit-each.ts` — `emitEachBodyRenderForFile()` emits a render fn that runs synchronously at
module-init. When the source cell is declared in the same file, `_scrml_reactive_set` runs
AFTER the render fn (module-init order). The bare `_scrml_reconcile_list(_mount, undefined, ...)`
threw `TypeError: ...newItems.length`. Fix: guard `if (!_items) { _mount.replaceChildren(); return; }`
before reconcile; `_scrml_effect_static` subscription re-runs the fn once cell-init fires.

### `<each>`-in-dynamic-context sweep (S153) — every place an `<each>` lives inside a dynamic mount

**engine-gated `<each>` never populates (54d54d4d, the req2 blocker)** — an `<each>` whose mount
lives in a non-`initial=` engine arm is absent from the DOM at module-init; the render hit
`if (!_mount) return;` BEFORE reading `@cell` → `_scrml_effect_static`'s one-shot dep pass recorded
no dependency → never re-fired. Three coupled codegen modes: (A) `emit-each.ts` reads `_items`
BEFORE the `!_mount` early-return (always tracks the dep); (B) `emit-variant-guard.ts` + runtime —
`_scrml_each_renderers` registry + `_scrml_remount_each(root)` helper the arm-swap dispatcher calls
after innerHTML+wire; (C) `emit-client.ts` `detectRuntimeChunks` descends into engine `bodyChildren`
(was tree-shaking the reconcile/effect chunks out → ReferenceError).

**`<each>` in a block-form `<match>` arm emits invalid JS (3429b385, was E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS)** —
match arms are raw text (`armsRaw`); `emit-match` re-parsed via `nativeParseFile` → a generic
`markup tag="each"`, NOT an `each-block` (the each-block transform lives in `buildAST`, not the
native parser) → rendered inline with `@.` unscoped (`.name` leak). Fix: each-bearing arms re-parse
via `splitBlocks`+`buildAST`; `restampEachBlockIds` namespaces ids; lifted each-blocks attach to
`matchBlock.bodyChildren` so `collectEachBlocks` emits the render fn with the `@.` rewrite;
`__scrmlCachedArms` memoizes across the two passes. The S152 #1 "covers block-form match" claim was
aspirational (hook wired but each-in-match never compiled) — now real.

**`:`-shorthand child inside an engine arm breaks state-child parsing (c89c1cb1, was
E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-MISSING)** — a §4.14 `:`-shorthand child (`<li : @.name>`) inside an engine
state-child broke closer-pairing (valid at top-level; only broke in an engine arm). The 3
closer-finders in `engine-statechild-parser.ts` pushed non-void lowercase openers onto `lowerDepth`;
a `:`-shorthand opener has no closer → the phantom unbalanced opener absorbed the state-child `</>`.
Fix: attr-aware `isColonShorthandOpener` (whitespace-preceded depth-0 non-string `:`; tracks
string/paren/brace/bracket/`${}` so `bind:`/`on:`/`style="x:y"`/`${a?b:c}` aren't mis-detected)
wired into all 3 finders, mirroring the void/self-close exclusions.

**`<each>` over an enclosing-scope binding (e6870f25, was E-SCOPE-001 / E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS)** —
two bugs, one root (file-scope each emission can't see enclosing scope): (A) nested `<each>` (the
`as` pattern) — the inner each was lifted to module-scope reading `group.items` (undefined) →
ReferenceError; fix = inline emission in the outer factory via shared `emitEachReconcileLines`.
(B) `<each>` in a component body — `@.id` E-SCOPE-001 + `.name` leak; 3 roots in
`component-expander.ts` (native parser doesn't promote each/match → legacy `splitBlocks`+`buildAST`
re-parse fallback; `substituteProps` missed each-block string fields; tokenized `@ . id` collapse).

## Error Handling Patterns
- All compile errors returned as CGError[] in result.errors or result.warnings
- Caller checks result.errors.length to determine if compilation succeeded
- No exceptions thrown for source-level errors; exceptions only for internal compiler bugs
- `compileScrml()` in api.js is the single error-surface boundary

## Global Error Boundaries
No client-level JS error boundaries in the compiler itself.
The emitted scrml app gets `errorBoundary` support via `emit-error-boundary.ts` (§19.6).
errorBoundary compile support: `compiler/src/codegen/emit-error-boundary.ts` (320L) — extracts
fallback markup + per-variant renders; paired with host-JS try/catch backstop (§19.6.8 C-hybrid).
