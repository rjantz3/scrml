The domain is the scrml COMPILER pipeline. scrml is a single-file, full-stack reactive web
language compiled by this TypeScript/JS toolchain running on Bun. The compiler converts `.scrml`
source files into `*.server.js` + `*.client.js` + `*.html` + `*.css` outputs.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| `.scrml` file | Single-file source combining markup, logic, styles, SQL, auth, types, and tests |
| Pipeline | 12 ordered stages: BS → TAB → NR → MOD → CE → PA → RI → TS → META → VSS → DG → CG |
| BS (Block Splitter) | Stage 1: tokenizes `.scrml` into typed blocks (markup/logic/sql/css/etc.) — `block-splitter.js` |
| TAB (Tokenizer+AST Builder) | Stage 2: builds FileAST from block stream — `tokenizer.ts` + `ast-builder.js`; the `each-block`/`match-block` structural transform lives HERE (in `buildAST`), NOT in the native parser |
| NR (Name Resolver) | Stage 3: resolves reactive decls, engine vars, component refs — `name-resolver.ts` |
| MOD (Module Resolver) | Stage 3.1: builds import graph, detects circular imports, produces export registry — `module-resolver.js` |
| CE (Component Expander) | Stage 3.2: expands component references via same-file + cross-file registries — `component-expander.ts`; re-parses synthesized component bodies, falling back to legacy `splitBlocks`+`buildAST` when the body contains `<each>`/`<match>` (S153) |
| PA (Pre-Analysis) | Stage 4: structural validation, attribute allowlists — `attribute-registry.js` + validators/ |
| RI (Route Inference) | Stage 5: infers server routes from page structure — `route-inference.ts` |
| TS (Type System) | Stage 6: type checking, validity surface synthesis, engine type verification — `type-system.ts` (17374L) |
| META (Meta Check+Eval) | Stage 6.5: validates phase separation, evaluates `^{}` compile-time blocks — `meta-checker.ts` + `meta-eval.ts` |
| VSS (Validity Surface Synthesis) | Stage 6.7: synthesizes `@x.isValid` / `@x.errors` / `@x.touched` / `@x.submitted` accessor cells |
| DG (Dependency Graph) | Stage 7: builds reactive dependency DAG, detects cycles — `dependency-graph.ts` |
| CG (Code Generator) | Stage 8: emits server.js + client.js + html + css from IR — `code-generator.js` + codegen/ |
| FileAST | Compiler's internal AST representation for one .scrml file — `types/ast.ts` (1983L+) |
| CGError | Structured diagnostic: code + message + span + severity — `codegen/errors.ts` |
| V5-strict | Access model: `@x` is read, `@x = v` is write; compiler tracks every read/write site |
| reactive-decl | A V5-strict reactive variable (`@name`): server-side cell with compile-time dependency tracking |
| engine | State machine declared in scrml (`<engine>`/`EngineDeclNode`); Tier 2 abstraction over reactive cells |
| engine state-child | A state arm of an engine declared as a markup child; closer-pairing handled by the custom raw-text parser `engine-statechild-parser.ts` (NOT block-splitter) |
| `:`-shorthand child (§4.14) | `<tag : expr>` form (e.g. `<li : @.name>`); correctly excluded from engine-arm closer-depth via `isColonShorthandOpener` (S153) — a `:`-shorthand opener has no closer, so it must not be pushed onto `lowerDepth` (else it absorbs the state-child `</>` → E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-MISSING) |
| engine opener `effect=` | §51.0.H Form 3 boot-only opener effect; fires once at engine init; emitted by `emitEngineOpenerEffect()` in emit-engine.ts (S148 C1) |
| `accepts=MsgType` (§51.0.S.2.2) | Engine-opener attribute naming the message-vocabulary `:enum`; parsed batch 1 (engine-statechild-parser.ts, S154); resolved batch 2 (symbol-table.ts SYM PASS 11, S155); codegen batch 3 (emit-engine.ts `emitEngineMessageArmTable`, S155) |
| message-arm (§51.0.S) | Per-state `| .Variant(bindings) :> body` arms inside an engine state-child; parsed to `MessageArmEntry[]` by batch 1; two-plane dispatch: state-transitions via `_scrml_engine_advance`, message-dispatch via `_scrml_engine_dispatch_message` (runtime-template.js S155) |
| engine-graph sidecar | Static "what-comes-next" JSON artifact per engine; written to `<base>.engine-graph.json` via `--emit-engine-graph`; produced by `buildEngineGraphJson()` in `engine-graph.ts` (S149) |
| EngineGraph | Exported type from engine-graph.ts: `{ engines: EngineGraphEngine[] }`; honest-empty `{ engines: [] }` when no engines |
| errorBoundary | Markup-context error catch (§19.6): typed `!`-error path + host-JS try/catch backstop; implemented in `emit-error-boundary.ts` |
| `lin` (linear type) | Value that must be consumed exactly once; enforced by compiler across all branches — `LinDeclNode` |
| `~` (tilde-decl) | Deferred-init mutable slot; must be initialized before read — `TildeDeclNode` |
| channel | Server-push WebSocket channel declared in markup; `<channel name="X">` — `ChannelDeclNode` |
| SSE (§37) | Server-Sent Events; client-stub wiring via `EventSource` — `emit-client.ts` GITI-026 |
| `_scrml_modules` registry | §21.3 cross-file CLIENT module-loading (known-gaps #6, S152); idempotent global object in runtime-template.js; exporter appends `_scrml_modules[key] = { ... }` footer; importer reads via `const { x } = _scrml_modules[key]`; key derived by `moduleRegistryKey()` from absolute path + outputBaseDir |
| source-map provenance | Real per-line `.js.map` produced by build-source-map.ts + srcmap-provenance.ts; emit fns inject `#scrmlmap#` sentinel marks; buildSourceMap() resolves them to use-site spans and strips marks before output (S149 B2; S150 line-lie close) |
| Shape 4 typed-array default | §6.2 Shape 4 (S152): `<name>: T[]` with no RHS defaults to `[]`; non-array typed decl with no RHS → E-DECL-NEEDS-INITIALIZER. (Open design Q parked S153: scalar/struct zero-default — should `<x>: int`→`0`, `<x>: string`→`""`?) |
| `<each>` cell-init order | (S152 HIGH): `<each>` body render fn runs synchronously at module-init BEFORE same-file cell `_scrml_reactive_set`; guard `if (!_items)` added; `_scrml_effect_static` re-runs after cell-init fires |
| `<each>` dep-first read | (S153): the render fn reads `_items` (the dependency) BEFORE the `if (!_mount) return;` early-return so `_scrml_effect_static`'s one-shot dep pass records the dep even when the mount is absent at module-init (the engine-gated case) |
| `_scrml_each_renderers` / `_scrml_remount_each` | (S153): runtime registry + remount helper in runtime-template.js. An `<each>` whose mount lives in a non-`initial=` engine arm is absent from the DOM at module-init; its render fn registers itself keyed `each_${id}`; when the arm later mounts, the variant-swap dispatcher (emit-variant-guard.ts) calls `_scrml_remount_each(armRoot)` which `querySelectorAll('[data-scrml-each-mount]')` and re-invokes each registered renderer directly (no new dep edge). Idempotent across engine re-entry |
| each-in-block-form-match | (S153): each-bearing `<match>` arms re-parse via `splitBlocks`+`buildAST` (native parser leaves a generic `markup tag="each"`); lifted each-blocks attach to `matchBlock.bodyChildren`; `restampEachBlockIds` namespaces ids; `__scrmlCachedArms` memoizes across passes — emit-match.ts |
| each-over-enclosing-scope | (S153): nested `<each>` (the `as` pattern) emits inline in the outer factory via shared `emitEachReconcileLines` (was lifted to module-scope reading undefined enclosing var → ReferenceError); each-in-component-body fixed via the 3 component-expander roots |
| `<each>` engine-ctx threading (Bug 62) | (S156): `buildEachEngineCtx(fileAST)` in emit-each.ts collects per-file engine metadata once (engines with message arms, message-variant sets) and threads `EachEngineCtx` through every per-item template attr/child lowering so `@engine.advance(.X)` / `@engine = .X` inside `<each>` templates lower correctly to the state or message plane. Bug 65 (S157) is the SAME fix applied at the Tier-0 `${for…lift}` path in emit-lift.js — CLOSED (see below). |
| `${for…lift}` engine-ctx threading (Bug 65) | (S157 — CLOSED): `buildLiftEngineCtx(fileAST)` + `buildLiftEngineCtxFromExtras(extras)` in emit-lift.js delegate to `buildEachEngineCtx` (emit-each.ts) so both tiers share one implementation. Engine extras are threaded via emit-logic opts into `emitForStmt` → `emitConsolidatedLift` / `emitCreateElementFromMarkup`. Also: `tryLowerLiftEngineHandler` delegates to `emitEngineHandlerBody` (emit-each) — no duplicated `.advance` logic. |
| per-item content reactivity (Bug 64 / R28-1c) | (S158 — CLOSED): `_scrml_reconcile_list` reuses DOM nodes for same-key items; per-item TEXT + class: bindings that close over the create-time iter var showed STALE content on array-replace/reorder. Fix: `EachReconcileCtx` stack in emit-each.ts + `_scrml_lift_reconcile_ctx_stack` in emit-lift.js + control-flow.ts push of ctx inside `createFn`. `maybeWrapEachPerItemEffect`/`maybeWrapLiftPerItemEffect` wrap per-item bindings in a live-keyed `_scrml_effect` that calls `_scrml_resolve_item(mount, keyVar)` to get the CURRENT item for the node's create-time key. `_scrml_resolve_item` in runtime-template.js tracks `(container, "_scrml_items")` so `_scrml_trigger(container, "_scrml_items")` (fired by `_scrml_reconcile_list` on each pass after first) re-fires these effects; field reads through `_scrml_deep_reactive` proxy subscribe to field-level mutations. |
| nested `<each>` in Tier-0 lift (Bug 72) | (S158 — CLOSED): a `<each>` child of lifted markup arrives at codegen as a generic `markup` node (ast-builder's `parseLiftTag` never promotes to `each-block`). Pre-fix: rendered as literal `<each>` DOM tag + inner `@.` leaked raw → E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS. Fix: `tryEmitNestedLiftEach` in emit-lift.js routes through `emitNestedEachFromMarkup` (emit-each.ts). Also: `_parseLiftAttrValue` in ast-builder.js now handles `PUNCT "@"` token by collecting the balanced `@...` token run as an `{kind:"expr"}` value, keeping the lift on the structured markup path. |
| render-by-tag nested compound (Bug 60) | (S157 — CLOSED): `<signupForm><userName/></>` — self-tag `<userName/>` failed lookup because bare `lookupStateCell` can't see it; it lives under the compound parent namespace. Fix: `enclosingCompoundStack: string[]` in emit-html.ts tracks the active compound wrapper tag; fallback `lookupQualifiedStateCell(fileScope, [enclosing, tag])` resolves the nested field and emits the render-by-tag expansion. Dependency-graph.ts structural-read credit added for render-by-tag tag names (E-DG-002 false-positive cleared). |
| `given` guard | §42.2.3 presence guard: `given ident [, ident]* => { body }`; produces `kind: "given-guard"` AST node; standalone form `:>` ratified S148 as Insight-33 extension |
| formFor | Type-driven form generation from struct definition (§41.14) — `emit-form-for.ts` |
| schemaFor | Type-driven schema emission (§41 family) — `emit-schema-for.ts`; S156 (d)-A batch 3 adds enum-subset `CHECK IN` lowering (§41.15.6 + §41.15.8a): a `Role oneOf([.Admin,.Editor])` field column emits `CHECK (col IN ('Admin','Editor'))` in declaration order |
| tableFor | Type-driven table rendering (§41 family) — `emit-table-for.ts` |
| native-parser | In-progress scrml-native replacement for BS+TAB; `compiler/native-parser/`; activated via `--parser=scrml-native`. HARD M5-swap precondition (S153, witnessed twice): does NOT promote `<each>`/`<match>` to structural each-block/match-block nodes — when it becomes default it MUST, or every each/match breaks |
| library mode | Compile mode that emits ES module exports JS + server JS without HTML/runtime (SPEC §12.6); `emit-library.ts`; suppresses `.server.js` for body-content-escalated fns |
| arm separator `:>` | Canonical match / `!{}`-handler / `given`-guard arm separator (SPEC §18.2 / §34, S147-S148); `=>` and `->` are deprecated aliases; all three parse, build, and emit identically during the deprecation window |
| W-MATCH-ARROW-LEGACY | Info-level diagnostic emitted at every match arm or `!{}`-handler arm using a deprecated `=>` or `->` separator; suggests `bun scrml migrate --fix` for AST-driven rewrite |
| per-file watcher | `commands/dev.js` (S152): Bun `fs.watch` per-file (not recursive-dir) to avoid inotify exhaustion; degrades gracefully on ENOSPC limit |
| enum-subset refinement (§53.15.1) | `Role oneOf([.Admin,.Editor])` / `Role notIn([.Guest])` type annotation form (S156 (d)-A); parsed by shared `parseEnumSubsetAnnotation()` in `enum-subset-refinement.ts`; materialized as `PredicatedType` with `subsetVariants: Set<string>` (already complemented for `notIn`) in type-system.ts; three consumers: (1) match exhaustiveness narrowed to subset variants (§18.8.1 / §18.0.1); (2) `["A","B"].includes(v)` boundary check codegen in emit-predicates.ts; (3) `CHECK IN` subset in schemaFor emit-schema-for.ts. Range form `.A .. .B` is explicitly forbidden (reintroduces SPARK RPP02 union-evolution hazard) |
| `E-MATCH-SUBSET-DEAD-ARM` | Dead arm diagnostic (S156 (d)-A): a `<match>` arm names a variant outside the declared subset — it can never be reached. Emitted by both type-system.ts (full type-resolution pass) and symbol-table.ts PASS 20 (string-based exhaustiveness pass via shared recognizer) |
| `_scrml_engine_dispatch_message` | Runtime helper (S155, runtime-template.js): resolves `(state × message)` dispatch table; calls per-state arm fn (receives `stateData, msgData`); routes result to `_scrml_engine_advance`; implements §51.0.R handled-message idle-reset |
| `_scrml_reconcile_list` key→item map | (S158): `container._scrml_item_by_key: Map<key, item>` built on EVERY reconcile pass (including fast-path B2 same-order bail); `_scrml_trigger(container, "_scrml_items")` re-fires per-item effects after map rebuild. This is the runtime side of Bug 64 / R28-1c. |
| `_scrml_resolve_item(container, key)` | (S158, runtime-template.js): reads `container._scrml_item_by_key`, tracks `(container, "_scrml_items")` via `_scrml_track`, returns live item wrapped in `_scrml_deep_reactive` (null when key gone — canonical absence §42.5). Used by live-keyed per-item effects emitted by `maybeWrapEachPerItemEffect` / `maybeWrapLiftPerItemEffect`. |
| match-as-expression exhaustiveness (S157) | `const x = match @cell { ... }` (let/const/return positions) now hooks into the exhaustiveness pass: ast-builder.js dual-parse inserts a structural `matchExpr` side-field; type-system.ts `checkMatchDiagnostics` runs on it (E-TYPE-020). Also: derived `const <x> = match @cell { ... }` reactive cell (Bug 71). |
| E-SYNTAX-064 / redundant-CODEGEN suppression | (S157): `@.` outside an `<each>` body scope now fires E-SYNTAX-064 (both the attr-walk site in the TS pass and the markup-attr-value walk site) instead of leaking to E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS. api.js suppresses E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS when compilation already has a prior fatal error (Bug 70). |

## Business Invariants (from SPEC + code)
- `null` and `undefined` do NOT exist in scrml source; both → `not` (SPEC §42; `W-ABSENCE-IN-SCRML-SOURCE`)
- Client JS MUST NOT contain SQL execution calls, server env access, or other server-only constructs (E-CG-006)
- `<auth role="X">` gates JS-mount only, NOT served HTML content (W-AUTH-CONTENT-NOT-GATED, GITI-027A)
- Every reactive write site must be in a logic context (E-WRITE-NOT-IN-LOGIC-CONTEXT)
- `lin`-typed values must be consumed exactly once across all code paths
- `async`/`await` are forbidden in scrml source (E-ASYNC-NOT-IN-SCRML, E-AWAIT-NOT-IN-SCRML); CPS is the canonical async surface
- `switch`/`try`/`throw` are forbidden scrml vocabulary (E-SWITCH-FORBIDDEN, E-THROW-NOT-IN-SCRML, E-TRY-NOT-IN-SCRML)
- Engine state-children are canonical state-machine representations; nested engines are permitted
- Match / `!{}`-handler / `given`-guard arm separator is `:>`; `=>` / `->` are deprecated aliases — new code SHALL use `:>` (SPEC §18.2 / §34)
- Typed-array decl with no RHS defaults to `[]` (§6.2 Shape 4); non-array typed decl with no RHS is E-DECL-NEEDS-INITIALIZER
- An `<each>`/`<match>` body render must remain reachable from the file's runtime-chunk walk even when the mount lives only inside an engine/match arm `bodyChildren` (S153 — else the reconcile/effect chunks are tree-shaken → ReferenceError)
- The each render's reactive dependency must be recorded at module-init regardless of mount presence (read `_items` before the `!_mount` early-return) so a later arm-mount re-render has a live subscription (S153)
- An `<each>` template's event handlers that contain `.advance(.X)` or `@engine = .X` MUST go through the engine-ctx lowering path (`emitEngineHandlerBody`) in emit-each.ts — direct lowering without ctx produces stale `undefined`-call JS (Bug 62 root cause; Bug 65 was the same gap in emit-lift.js — CLOSED S157)
- `oneOf`/`notIn` enum-subset refinements: range form `.A .. .B` is forbidden (§53.15.1); the argument must be an explicit enumerated set; `notIn` is complemented to positive IN-SET at resolution time (both loci read the same positive set)
- Per-item TEXT / class: / attr bindings in both Tier-1 `<each>` and Tier-0 `${for…lift}` MUST be wrapped in a live-keyed `_scrml_effect` via `maybeWrapEachPerItemEffect` / `maybeWrapLiftPerItemEffect` so same-key reconcile (array-replace, reorder) does not show stale content (Bug 64 / R28-1c — CLOSED S158)
- `_scrml_resolve_item(container, key)` returns `null` (NOT `undefined`) when the key is gone — canonical compiled-output absence is `null` per SPEC §42.5; the W-CG-UNDEFINED-INTERPOLATION lint forbids `undefined` in emitted JS
- E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS is SUPPRESSED when the compilation already has a prior fatal error (Bug 70); the gate's contract is "emits valid JS for VALID source" — firing it on top of an earlier error is misleading

## Domain Events / Diagnostic Codes (key runtime lifecycle)
W-AUTH-CONTENT-NOT-GATED — emitted when `<auth role>` is used without content gating (GITI-027A)
W-MATCH-ARROW-LEGACY — emitted (info-level) at every match / `!{}`-handler arm using deprecated `=>` or `->` separator (S147, SPEC §18.2 / §34)
W-EACH-PROMOTABLE — emitted (info-level) at `${ for (let x of @cell) { lift ... } }` sites eligible for `<each>` promotion (S130 HU-1, Stage 6.4c)
W-EACH-KEY-001 — emitted (info-level) at `<each in=@cell>` sites where items have no inferable `.id` key (S130 HU-1, Stage 6.4d)
E-DECL-NEEDS-INITIALIZER — emitted at non-array typed-decl with no RHS (S152 §6.2 Shape 4)
E-ENGINE-STATE-CHILD-MISSING — engine state-child closer un-findable; S153 fixed the `:`-shorthand-child false-fire class
E-ENGINE-ACCEPTS-NOT-ENUM — (S155) `<engine for=T>` declares `accepts=MsgType` but `MsgType` is absent or non-`:enum` [symbol-table.ts SYM PASS 11]
E-ENGINE-MSG-WITHOUT-ACCEPTS — (S155) a state-child declares a message arm (`| .Variant :>`) but the engine has no `accepts=` [symbol-table.ts PASS 20]
E-ENGINE-MSG-ARM-NOT-EXHAUSTIVE — (S155) a state declares message arms but the set does not cover all `accepts=` enum variants and has no wildcard arm [symbol-table.ts PASS 20]
E-ENGINE-MSG-UNKNOWN — (S155) `.advance(.X)` targets a variant that is in NEITHER the state-transition plane NOR the message-dispatch plane [type-system.ts]
E-MATCH-SUBSET-DEAD-ARM — (S156 (d)-A batch 2+4) a match arm names a variant excluded by the matched cell's `oneOf`/`notIn` subset refinement — it is unreachable [type-system.ts + symbol-table.ts PASS 20]
E-SYNTAX-064 — (S157 Bug 70/73) `@.` contextual sigil used outside an `<each>` body scope; fired at both the TS attr-walk site and the markup-attr-value walk site [type-system.ts:6643 + 7434]
I-MATCH-PROMOTABLE — info diagnostic suggesting match → engine promotion (§56)
I-FN-PROMOTABLE — info diagnostic suggesting function promotion
