# scrml — deputy state (re-hydration anchor)

**Created S203 (2026-06-17).** The vPA deputy's durable re-hydration anchor — the small file the
deputy re-boots off when its transcript grows (cheap + lossless because the deputy does projection,
not deliberation; see `scrml-support/vpa-scrml.md` §"Re-hydration"). **Deputy-owned** (write-surface
partition); the deputy maintains it on the `deputy-maint` branch. The PA reads it but does not edit it.

---

## Deputy status

- **State:** LIVE — steady-state (S205 active). First deputy instance, booted S203. On tick 15.
- **Self-poke loop:** `/loop 30m` — cron job `39fed15c`, `7,37 * * * *`. CronDelete `39fed15c` to cancel.
- **Last-absorbed delta seq:** S205 **[6]** (`scrml/handOffs/delta-log.md` — absorbed [S199 1] … [S205 6]).
- **`deputy-maint` branch:** worktree `/home/bryan-maclee/scrmlMaster/scrml-deputy-maint`. Descends main `897a2c69` (the S205 PA FF-merged the tick-14 work). **Tip:** `git rev-parse deputy-maint` (tick-15: digest regen `185dc08d` + this).
- **Owed maintenance:** none.

## ✅ The merge-before-push pattern is RESOLVED (contract-level, S205 [2])

The recurring 2× strand (S203 digest-miss + S204 maps-miss) is **structurally closed**: the PA **ratified a HARD pre-push merge gate** into `pa-scrml.md` S199 addendum + wrap **step 7** — assert `git rev-list --count deputy-maint ^main == 0` before any push, else the session ships without the deputy's maintenance. The tick-13 recommendation was adopted verbatim. **Evidence it works:** the **S205 cold boot read a CURRENT digest** (first clean digest boot — S204 booted stale) **→ thin-start REALIZED** (master-list §0 skipped), and the S204 maps-owed thread resolved at boot (deputy-maint FF-merged → maps `cc765a5a` picked up). The deputy F1 function now delivers as designed when the gate holds.

## F1 dilation — REALIZED + confirmed (S205 [3])

The clean-cycle re-measure (the S204 [6] follow-up) ran: digest booted current → **F1 realized ~8.3k** (master-list §0's 9,364 tok skipped − 1,035 tok thin path), confirming+exceeding the S204 7-8k projection (which realized **0** in S204 because the digest booted stale). F2 ~6-7k (deputy maps+regens FF-merged at boot). Total ~14-15k/cycle ≈ 1.5%/1M — the S204 band HOLDS, F1 now realized. (vpa-deputy DD §S205-remeasurement.)

## Flogeance components building (PA work — observed, not deputy surface)

- **dock** (`scripts/dock.ts`) — the adopted agentic-code-provenance dock checker, thin-built S205 ([4], `40590c73`); slices 1-2 ([6], `686dc795`) = coverage walker over scrml `.scrml` defs (`// #dock[…]`). REAL baseline: **628 reasoning-units / 120 files / 0% docked** (greenfield). Rides flograph.
- **flograph** slice 4 ([5], `7d53119f`) — cites/derivation layer + `--derivation` traversal. (Earlier: `--mmd`/`--filter`/`--focus` + slices 1-3 supersession/currency.)
- The S204 update message to flogeance's inbox (baton-retired/deputy/dilation/flograph/dock) was delivered 2026-06-18 (flogeance `e5c3991`, local — no remote).

## In-flight dispatches (F3 watch list)

- _(empty)_ — `af88c53a` landed (#3); `abcf64f7` closed tick 5.

## Tick log (compressed)

T1 boot [S199-S203]; T2-T3 F1 LIVE + GO-LIVE; T4-T5 e2e/flograph; **T6-T8 reboot-gap** (#3 in-flight bridged → fresh PA re-attached + LANDED); **T9-T11** S204 [1-6] (#3 landed, flograph slices, dilation ~3% frame-fix); **T12** maps REFRESHED (60d547e1→cc765a5a, user ruling); **T13** 2nd merge-before-push miss flagged; **T14** PA caught up; **T15** absorbed S205 [1-6] — merge-before-push gate RATIFIED + F1 realized ~8.3k + dock built; digest regen. **LESSON (T15):** the source-based digest oracle CAUGHT an absorb-miss (pre-rebase delta-log read showed [8], missed the S205 block) → **always re-check the delta-log AFTER sync/rebase, not before.**

## Currency snapshot (@ tick 15)

- **Board:** HIGH 0 · MED 11 · LOW 23 · Nominal 8 (S204 wrap: MED 12→11).
- **maps:** watermark `cc765a5a` — CURRENT for compiler-source (no compiler-source since; S205 work is all `scripts/` tooling — dock/flograph/state). In main (origin) since the S205 boot integration.
- **digest:** current (head `897a2c69`, delta-seq S205 [6]).
- **recent-sessions / gap-counts:** PASS.
- **flograph/dock:** building (see above) — `scripts/flograph.ts` + `scripts/dock.ts`.

## Function 3 — agent monitoring (LIVE)

Each tick: `ls .claude/worktrees/` + `git -C <agent-wt> log/status`; scan delta-log for `disp` without `land`/`find`-close. **Append a `(deputy) state` delta-log entry ONLY when** an agent COMPLETED **and the PA is absent/rebooting** (narrow single-writer exception — observation-only). NEVER land (PA S67 file-delta). Poll git-state.

## Sync rule (each tick)

`git merge --ff-only main`; if NOT clean FF → `git rebase main` (clean on the disjoint surface; a real conflict = partition breach to surface). **Re-check the delta-log + run `state.ts --check`/digest-oracle AFTER syncing** (a pre-sync read can miss new entries — T15 lesson; the oracle is the backstop). Main may move/push mid-tick.

## Operational notes (for re-hydration)

- **node_modules:** fresh worktree has NONE → symlink main's in (survives FF+rebase): `ln -s /home/bryan-maclee/scrmlMaster/scrml/node_modules ./node_modules` · `ln -s /home/bryan-maclee/scrmlMaster/scrml/compiler/node_modules ./compiler/node_modules`
- **CWD slip:** Bash CWD resets to MAIN — `cd` the worktree (or `git -C`) before worktree ops.
- **Untracked new file:** `git add` before commit; tracked modifications commit by plain pathspec.
- **Maps refresh:** project-mapper into the worktree (CWD-pinned, worktree-only brief) + `git -C <main> status` clean-verify before committing (resolved T12; user ruled no-consent-needed).
- **Commit gate:** pre-commit WARNS on non-main; runs ~17k subset (~75-120s); deputy commits derived-only → pass; never `--no-verify`. `git rebase` does NOT run the gate.

## Maintenance seams (Function 2)

- `.claude/maps/*` — `project-mapper` into the worktree; watermark `.claude/maps/primary.map.md` (`cc765a5a`).
- `docs/changelog.md` — session block. · `@generated` §0 rollup (`docs/known-gaps.md`) + `master-list.md` §0.6 — `bun scripts/state.ts --write` (gate `--check`).
- `handOffs/digest.md` — `bun scripts/state.ts --digest` (F1; per tick when a projected source moved — known-gaps/delta-log/maps/version).
- flograph — `scripts/flograph.ts`. · dock checker — `scripts/dock.ts` (PA-built; deputy observes). · block-lease registry — (not built yet).
