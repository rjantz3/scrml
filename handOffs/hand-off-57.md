# scrmlTS — Session 56 (CLOSED — implementation-prep session, 4 dispatchable briefs landed, kickstarter v2 fully L1-L20 compliant)

**Date opened:** 2026-05-04
**Date closed:** 2026-05-04 (same day; long single-session implementation-prep arc)
**Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-56.md` (S55 close — PIVOTAL fat wrap, 21 architectural moves locked, north star articulated, migration burden dissolved, deliberation arc complete)
**Pre-save target:** `handOffs/hand-off-57.md` (this file, pre-saved at S56 close as forensic preservation; identical to `hand-off.md` at this commit)

**Baseline entering S56:** scrmlTS at `8d10463` (S55 close wrap, pushed). 8,576 pass / 40 skip / 0 fail / 426 files (per S55 hand-off — note pre-commit hook excludes browser tests so per-commit count is 7,851 pass / 30 skip / 0 fail / 398 files; 0 fails is what matters). scrml-support clean+pushed. Inbox empty.

**State at S56 close:** scrmlTS at `f912846` (Dispatch 4 brief commit, pushed) + this wrap commit. **Test counts UNCHANGED**: pre-commit hook reports 7,851 pass / 30 skip / 0 fail / 398 files at every dispatch commit. Zero compiler/code changes this session — all work was design-doc writes + alignment fixes + pre-written dispatch briefs. **Net delta from S55 close: 0 compiler changes, but 9 substantial commits across two repos building the implementation-phase machinery.**

## 0. The big shape of S56 — IMPLEMENTATION-PREP SESSION

S56 is the session where the v0.next deliberation arc TRANSITIONED INTO implementation-prep. S55 closed deliberation; S56 opened with the user authorizing parallel tracks (compiler + docs continuously) and locking the kickstarter-first sequencing. By session close, the implementation phase has a complete dispatchable plan.

User verbatim (S56 directives):
> parallel. this is the clean break. the name is fine for now, no holds barred
> hybrid on tests, kickstarter-first, phase A1 as one dispatch but make sure it is updating as it goes so we dont lose work, and make sure it has permissions

The session ran two distinct arcs:

### Arc 1 — Continuation deliberation (S56 push-on, L11-L20)

After PA drafted kickstarter v2 and surfaced 4 open clusters from the §4 still-open list, user authorized push-on. Direct PA-user discussion mode produced **9 additional locks (L11-L19)** closing all four clusters, plus **L20** addressing the S55-carryover `derived=` attribute grammar. Total S56 locks: **L1-L20.**

### Arc 2 — Implementation-prep (the actual session goal)

After the L20 lock, the session pivoted to producing dispatchable implementation machinery:
1. Comprehensive Stage 0a SPEC + PIPELINE impact assessment (446 lines)
2. Pre-written dispatch briefs for ALL FOUR Stage 0b dispatches (Dispatch 1-4)
3. Kickstarter v2 alignment pass + immutability-semantics clarification

The implementation phase is now FULLY pre-written. Next session can dispatch Dispatch 1 immediately with no further prep.

## 1. The 20 locks (full catalog — S56)

L1-L10 from initial deliberation thread; L11-L19 from push-on; L20 from S55-carryover deliberation.

| # | Lock | Status |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Markup-as-first-class-value (PILLAR — held since scrml8 era) | **PILLAR ARTICULATED** |
| L2 | Compound state Variant C with canonical `@formRes.name` access | DECIDED |
| L3 | Decl-coupled-with-render-spec (`<name req> = <input/>`) | DECIDED |
| L4 | Partial validator vocabulary unification (no bilingual schema) | DECIDED |
| L5 | `is some` reused from existing scrml primitive (coexists with `req`) | CLARIFIED |
| L6 | Match Tier 0/1/2 ladder | DECIDED |
| L7 | Match attributes (rules-inert + `effect=`/`<onTransition>` engine-only) | DECIDED |
| L8 | Two match shapes coexist (block-form + JS-style) | DECIDED |
| L9 | `loose` flag dropped (rules-in-match obviates) | DECIDED |
| L10 | `reset()` as primitive | DECIDED IN PRINCIPLE — superseded by L18 |
| L11 | Auto-derived validity surface (ε — both compound + per-field, errors as enum tags) | DECIDED |
| L12 | Validator error-message origin (4d four-level resolution chain) | DECIDED |
| L13 | `<errors of=expr/>` first-class element | DECIDED |
| L14 | Cross-field validation via predicate args (no separate vocabulary) | DECIDED |
| L15 | `const <derived> = expr` (extended ALL-SCOPE during alignment pass) | DECIDED |
| L16 | Multi-render via existing access paths (no override syntax) | DECIDED |
| L17 | Compiler dispatches binding by render-spec; writable requires bindable | DECIDED |
| L18 | `reset(@cell)` keyword + `default=` attribute (γ semantics) | DECIDED — supersedes L10 |
| L19 | Multi-statement event handlers force named function | DECIDED |
| L20 | `derived=expr` engine attribute (any reactive expression of engine's type) | DECIDED |

**Plus const-immutability semantics formalized post-L15 alignment pass:** Reference-immutable YES; value-immutable depends on RHS deps; truly-frozen non-reactive constants drop the `<>` entirely. Open Q queued: `E-DERIVED-VALUE-MUTATE` on `@filteredItems.push(x)` (PA leans forbidden, not locked).

## 2. The four dispatchable briefs (Stage 0b machinery)

The implementation phase has Stage 0a (impact assessment, complete) and Stage 0b (spec rewrite execution, dispatchable). All four Stage 0b dispatches now have detailed dispatch-ready briefs:

| Dispatch | Title | Lines | Wall-time est | File |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation (§1 + §3 + §6 + §11 fold) | 502 | 14-27 hours | `DISPATCH-1-BRIEF-foundation.md` |
| 2 | Engines + Match + Validators + Substates + Control Flow | 801 | 29-50 hours | `DISPATCH-2-BRIEF-engines-match-validators.md` |
| 3 | Channels + Schema + Predicates + `not` keyword | 367 | 9-17 hours | `DISPATCH-3-BRIEF-channels-schema-predicates.md` |
| 4 | Cleanup + PIPELINE.md + SPEC-INDEX final | 381 | 18-33 hours | `DISPATCH-4-BRIEF-cleanup-pipeline-index.md` |

**Total Stage 0b: 70-127 hours of focused dispatch work** distributed across 4 bounded dispatches with crash-recovery discipline (commit-each-meaningful-change, progress.md updates, worktree-isolation).

Each brief contains:
- Worktree path discipline + dependency-landed verification at startup
- 8-9 source docs to read in full before any edit
- Per-section content sketches with subsection-level guidance
- Open questions queued for resolution during rewrite
- Concrete error-code lists (severity, trigger, fix)
- Dependency-respecting subsection ordering with checkpoints
- Wall-time estimate + checkpoint structure for partial-completion recovery

All briefs at `scrmlTS/docs/changes/v0next-spec-impact/`.

## 4. Push state at S56 close

| Repo | HEAD before this wrap | Wrap commit pending? | Push pending? |
|---|---|---|---|
| scrmlTS | `f912846` (Dispatch 4 brief, pushed) | YES — this wrap commit | YES |
| scrml-support | `2791701` (immutability ledger, pushed) | NO additional changes this wrap | NO |
| 6nz | not a git repo | N/A | N/A |

**Push authorization for scrmlTS wrap commit: PENDING USER GREENLIGHT** (or already implied by the standing wrap-and-push convention; surfacing for clarity).

---

## 5. State as of close (verified)

- **Tests:** 7,851 pass / 30 skip / 0 fail / 398 files (per pre-commit hook excluding browser). Per S55 hand-off historical record: 8,576 pass / 40 skip / 0 fail / 426 files including browser tests. **0 fails is what matters; UNCHANGED from S55 close.**
- **Working tree (scrmlTS):** clean before this wrap; will have hand-off + master-list + changelog modifications staged at wrap commit
- **Working tree (scrml-support):** clean (post final immutability ledger commit, pushed)
- **Inbox (`handOffs/incoming/`):** empty
- **Stage 0a impact assessment:** COMPLETE at `scrmlTS/docs/changes/v0next-spec-impact/IMPACT-ASSESSMENT.md` (446 lines)
- **Stage 0b dispatch briefs:** ALL FOUR pre-written, dispatchable as-is when next session opens
- **Kickstarter v2:** fully L1-L20 compliant (post-alignment-pass + post-immutability-clarification)
- **Outcomes ledger:** L1-L20 documented at `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/v0next-s56-deliberation-outcomes-2026-05-04.md`
- **User-voice:** S56 entries appended (pillar revelation + push-on dispositions + context-budget directive)

## 6. Open questions to surface immediately at S57 open

1. **Push authorization for scrmlTS wrap commit.** Implied by "commit and push what we can" earlier in S56, but explicit re-confirmation never given for THIS wrap commit. Surface at S57 open.

2. **Phase 0 Stage 0b kickoff: Dispatch 1 launch?** All four briefs are pre-written. Dispatch 1 is the foundation; can launch as soon as user authorizes. Question: launch immediately at S57 open, or do another round of planning/review first?

3. **S57 should be the first dispatch session OR another planning session?** PA leans dispatch (Stage 0b is the pre-written-dispatchable execution phase). User decides.

4. **Dispatch worktree paths** — when launching, fill in `<ABSOLUTE-WORKTREE-PATH-FILL-AT-DISPATCH-TIME>` placeholder in the brief with the actual worktree path. PA will handle this at dispatch time per pa.md F4.

5. **"No holds barred" authorization scope.** Was re-confirmed for S56. Implementation-phase dispatches need their own re-confirmation. Surface at S57 open.

6. **Open Q from L18/L15 alignment:** `E-DERIVED-VALUE-MUTATE` on `@filteredItems.push(x)`. PA leans forbidden; not currently locked. Will be resolved during Dispatch 2 spec rewrite OR in a future deliberation if it surfaces as load-bearing.

7. **The "v0.next" naming question** — still open from S55. User signaled keep-as-codename through S56. Eventually drop the qualifier; not blocking.

---

## 7. ⚠️ Things this PA needs to NOT screw up at S57 open

1. **Read user-voice S55 + S56 entries** at session-start checklist step 3. S55's verbatim ratifications + S56's pillar revelation (markup-as-first-class-value held since scrml8 era) + S56 context-budget directive are all load-bearing.

2. **The 20 locks (L1-L20) are the implementation surface.** Don't re-litigate. If a lock feels wrong during implementation, surface it explicitly; don't quietly drift away from it.

3. **Authorization scopes are SESSION-BOUNDED.** S56 "no holds barred" expired at S56 close. S57 implementation work needs its own authorization scope from the user.

4. **The new context-budget directive** (Opus 4.7 1M context, no wrap-suggestion above ~50% remaining without real reason). The wrap-suggestion threshold has CHANGED. Don't suggest wrap at 15-20% USED; suggest at 15-20% REMAINING.

5. **The four Stage 0b dispatch briefs are dispatch-ready.** When user authorizes Dispatch 1, the launch sequence is: (a) create worktree, (b) fill in `<ABSOLUTE-WORKTREE-PATH-FILL-AT-DISPATCH-TIME>` in the brief, (c) dispatch via `scrml-dev-pipeline` T3 with isolation: "worktree", (d) the brief is the prompt. Per pa.md global rules: commit-after-each-meaningful-change + progress.md.

6. **Markup-as-first-class-value pillar (L1)** is the load-bearing claim that threads through MANY dispatch sections. When checking Dispatch outputs against the spec, this pillar is the tiebreaker for "should this work in this position?" — answer is generally yes if it's an expression-position.

7. **`const <x> = expr` (NOT `const @x`)** is the canonical derived-cell decl form at all scopes. v1's `const @x` is superseded.

8. **Reset is a reserved keyword.** Don't define local `function reset() {...}` in any code example.

9. **The four briefs reference each other.** Dispatch 2 depends on 1; Dispatch 3 on 1+2; Dispatch 4 on 1+2+3. Don't dispatch out of order.

10. **`default=` attribute and `is some` predicate are L18/L5-locked but not in v1.** When reviewing scrml code examples, these are valid v0.next constructs.

11. **Test count discrepancy** — S55 hand-off cites 8,576/40/0/426; pre-commit reports 7,851/30/0/398. The discrepancy is the pre-commit excluding browser tests. 0 fails is what matters.

12. **Pre-S56 carryovers:** mostly resolved. Tagline refresh (post-implementation polish), Mario design file regen (canonical reference), self-host migration (operational) — all queued, not blocking.

13. **The "implementation-roadmap doc" was NOT written this session** — the four dispatch briefs serve that role for Stage 0b. A separate implementation-roadmap that sequences Stage 0b across sessions + then Phase A1+ compiler implementation could be a future planning artifact if the user wants it.

## 10. The seamless-transition guarantee

The next session's PA, on opening, should:
1. Read this hand-off (covers everything material)
2. Read user-voice-scrmlTS.md S56 entry (ground truth verbatims, particularly the markup-as-first-class-value pillar and context-budget directive)
3. Optionally skim the outcomes ledger (decisions detail) and one or more dispatch briefs (when about to launch a dispatch)
4. Have the full picture without needing to re-derive any decision

If the next PA finds themselves searching for "what does this mean" or "why was this decided," THIS HAND-OFF FAILED ITS PURPOSE. Surface that gap to the user immediately so we know what to fold into the next iteration.

The implementation phase is dispatchable. S57's first move is "launch Dispatch 1 or do further planning" — user's call.
