# PA ↔ vPA delta-log (flogeance — scrmlTS adaptation)

**Ratified S199 (2026-06-16).** The fine-grained PA→vPA absorption stream. The vPA reads
`[last-absorbed+1 .. now]` on a poke to stay current WITHOUT re-reading the fat hand-off or
cold-reading the docs. Append-only. Migrates into the `flogeance` repo when it's built; lives here now
for the 2-manual-terminal immediate-benefit mode.

**Format:** one block per entry —
```
[seq] kind  · what-happened  · → pointer  · (vpa: directive)
```
- **kind** ∈ `rule` (user decision) · `disp` (agent fired) · `land` (commit landed) · `find` (gap/bug/finding) · `state` (board/test/sync delta) · `baton` (handoff)
- **pointer** = SHA / file:line / gap-id / doc / agent-id (the vPA pulls detail only if needed)
- **(vpa: …)** = optional; the ONLY field that asks the vPA to do/note something (hold · sandbox a debate · take ownership of agent X · absorb-and-stand-by). Most entries omit it.

**Cadence:** the PA appends an entry at the moments it would write a hand-off bullet — a ruling, a
dispatch, a landing, a finding, a state delta — NOT per tool-call. The vPA absorbs the batch
since-last-poke at sparse checkpoints (prompt-cache TTL → don't poke constantly; keep vPA context lean).

**Relationship to the other logs:** distinct from user-voice (verbatim user statements, durable) and
the changelog (per-session landings, coarse). This stream is ephemeral-per-baton-cycle; it does NOT
replace the wrap hand-off (kept for cold-start safety + audit) — it replaces the vPA's *dependence* on it.

**Single-writer rule:** only the LIVE PA appends. The vPA is read-only on this file until the baton-pass.
