# scrmlTS — Session 43 (CLOSED)

**Date opened:** 2026-04-26
**Date closed:** 2026-04-26 (single calendar day)
**Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-43.md` (S42 closed)
**Baseline entering S43:** 7,906 pass / 40 skip / 0 fail / 378 files at `4db8d37`. Working tree clean. In sync with `origin/main`.
**State at S43 close:** **7,906 pass / 40 skip / 0 fail / 378 files** at `82e5b0d` (no compiler changes this session — pure design + agent-infrastructure work). scrmlTS pushed; **scrml-support push HELD** (see §1).

---

## 0. Pickup mode for next session

Per permanent context-density directive (S42): hand-off is deliberately bloated. Read this file in full before starting work. The S43 session was design-heavy (NOT compiler-heavy) — the work product is 8 deep-dives + joint synthesis + 5 forged tech-expert agents + a custom scrml-voice-author agent + a settings.json permission fix + a strategic vector confirmed across 8 independent investigations. Compiler test counts unchanged.

**One-paragraph state-of-the-world:** The "living compiler" investigation arc fired full bore. 7 deep-dives dispatched mid-session covering recoverability + comp-time-shape (A), mid-compile config swap `<compiler config=...>` (B), bridge architecture (C), meta-system capability frontier `^{}` (E), per-dev keyword alias layer (F), file storage source-vs-AST canonical (G), smart app splitting / "feel of performance" (H). All 7 landed (after C and H re-dispatches following silent stalls). User then committed superposition as an explicit language pillar mid-Q5-disambiguation; an 8th deep-dive was dispatched and landed via PA-write hybrid pattern after a 3rd silent stall. 5 user-disambiguation questions answered, sharpening debate framings. **6 landed dives independently converged on a single strategic vector** — content over name, source-canonical preserved, deterministic at compile time, distributed not centralized, phasing constraint respected — with superposition added as the unifying 6th metaphor. Permission fix to settings.json unblocked the agent-forge workflow; 5 foundational tech-experts forged (nix, unison, bazel, lean-lake, security). Custom `scrml-voice-author` agent built for bio + article drafting in the user's authentic voice. First article queued: *"Why programming for the browser needs a different kind of language"* (after bio is baked).

---

## 1. Open questions to surface IMMEDIATELY at session start

Surface these to the user before ANY further work:

1. **scrml-support push HELD** — 18 untracked files in `scrml-support/` accumulated this session, none committed. Includes 8 deep-dives + 8 progress files + joint coupling synthesis + user-voice-scrmlTS.md (still untracked from S43 reconciliation). User said "hold on 1" earlier and never re-authorized push. **Without push, none of S43's design work propagates to the other machine.** Decision needed: push from scrmlTS-machine, OR defer to master PA on the other machine after manual sync.

2. **2 stray progress files at scrml-support root** — `.progress-editor-keyword-alias-2026-04-26.md` and `.progress-smart-app-splitting-2026-04-26.md` are at scrml-support root level instead of `docs/deep-dives/` (where the other 6 progress files correctly live). Ought to be moved to `docs/deep-dives/` before scrml-support push.

3. **6nz inbox arrivals mid-S43** — 4 untracked files at `scrmlTS/handOffs/incoming/2026-04-26-1041-*` (1 message + 3 .scrml sidecar reproducers): bugs M/N/O from playground-six. Parked at user direction. **Need triage / intake / dispatch decision** before S44 substantive work.

4. **Master-PA inbox messages outstanding** — 2 messages dropped during S43 sit at `~/scrmlMaster/handOffs/incoming/`:
   - `2026-04-26-1230-scrmlTS-to-master-staleness-reconciliation-and-cross-machine-rule.md` (recommends propagating cross-machine sync rule to other pa.md files)
   - The earlier S42 retraction message (S43 cleaned up the local CHANGELOG-scrmlTS.md but the inbox message about it is still in master inbox)

5. **bazel-toolchain-expert ambiguity** — when forging round 2 (B's debate experts), need to decide if `bazel-toolchain-expert` is meaningfully different from the already-forged `bazel-expert` or just a re-naming.

6. **`dist/` pollution** under `handOffs/incoming/dist/` — STILL pending disposition since S40 (5 sessions running). Files: `2026-04-22-0940-bugI-name-mangling-bleed.{client.js,html}`, `scrml-runtime.js`.

---

## 2. Living-compiler investigation arc — full state

This was THE major thread of S43. State of the entire arc:

### 2.1 All 8 deep-dives landed

| ID | Title | Lines | Status | Output path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Recoverability + comp-time-shape | 1,068 | Landed | `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/living-compiler-recoverability-and-comp-time-shape-2026-04-26.md` |
| B | Mid-compile config swap (`<compiler config=...>`) | 876 | Landed | `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/living-compiler-mid-compile-config-swap-2026-04-26.md` |
| C | Bridge architecture | — | Landed (re-dispatch after stall) | `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/living-compiler-bridge-architecture-2026-04-26.md` |
| E | Meta-system capability frontier (`^{}`) | 638 | Landed | `../../scrml-support/archive/deep-dives/meta-system-capability-frontier-2026-04-26.md` |
| F | Per-dev keyword alias layer | — | Landed (no debate per Phase 5) | `../../scrml-support/archive/deep-dives/editor-keyword-alias-layer-2026-04-26.md` |
| G | File storage model (source vs AST canonical) | — | Landed | `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/file-storage-model-source-vs-ast-canonical-2026-04-26.md` |
| H | Smart app splitting / "feel of performance" | 588 | Landed (re-dispatch after stall) | `../../scrml-support/archive/deep-dives/smart-app-splitting-feel-of-performance-2026-04-26.md` |
| **Superposition** | Foundational pillar formalization | 788 | Landed (PA-write hybrid after 3rd stall) | `../../scrml-support/archive/deep-dives/superposition-as-language-pillar-2026-04-26.md` |
| **Joint A+B** | Coupling synthesis (PA-written) | ~150 | Landed | `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/joint-coupling-synthesis-A-B-2026-04-26.md` |

### 2.2 The strategic vector (load-bearing meta-finding)

**6 landed dives independently converged on the same shape.** This is the highest-confidence signal radical-doubt produced this session — multiple independent investigations arriving at compatible constraints means the constraints are real, not framing artifacts:

1. **Content over name** (A's "name-as-identity normatively forbidden"; G's source-canonical; C's hash-is-identity; Superposition's content-addressing as foundational)
2. **Source-canonical preserved** (G's smoking-gun finding via unisonweb/oss-transcripts; F's editor-alias-on-canonical; C's bridges-are-source-canonical) — *now CONDITIONAL after disambiguation #4 (AI-agent friction not load-bearing); B back in G's debate*
3. **Deterministic at compile time** (A presumes it; E flags it's currently unenforced — largest spec-vs-checks gap; C codifies as §X.5)
4. **Distributed not centralized** (gingerBill-aligned across all dives)
5. **Phasing constraint respected** (E + B converged on post-Stage-7 boundary; C codifies as §X.4)
6. **Superposition as foundational metaphor** — multiple states coexist until use collapses them; user committed explicit naming mid-S43

### 2.3 Three critical gaps surfaced (E's findings)

1. **`compiler.*` is a phantom.** SPEC §22.4 line 10461 names it; meta-checker classification regex matches it (`meta-checker.ts:168`); **no implementation exists.** User code calling `compiler.registerMacro(...)` passes classification, then ReferenceErrors at runtime.
2. **Determinism is unenforced.** `^{}` can read `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, `process.env`, do network I/O via `bun.eval`. SPEC §47 + A's recoverability story BOTH presume determinism scrml doesn't enforce. **A's R1-R4 readings are all currently unreachable** because the prerequisite is missing.
3. **Phasing inversion is architectural.** `^{}` runs Stage 7-8; custom syntax / reader macros / AST mutation are blocked at the `^{}` layer. Independent confirmation of B's same finding.

### 2.4 Pattern across dives — spec text exists without full implementation

E's `compiler.*` phantom + F's canonical+alias precedent already half-spec'd in §14.5/§18.2/§18.6/§48.11 = **same shape pattern.** Suggests broader candidate: a **spec-vs-implementation gap audit** deep-dive surveying where scrml promises more than the compiler delivers. Captured as candidate queued investigation.

### 2.5 Eliminated approaches (radical-doubt yield)

- **D (Curated Registry)** for bridges — re-introduces npm failure mode at name layer
- **B (AST-canonical / Unison-flavor)** for storage — initially eliminated, **then re-included** after user disambiguation #4 (AI-agent friction not load-bearing). Now G's debate is full A vs B vs C three-way with B favored under superposition lens.
- **D (Image-Based)** for recoverability — Smalltalk failure mode user is most explicit about avoiding

---

## 3. The 5 disambiguations — all answered

| # | Question | User answer | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A's R-reading: which is load-bearing (R1/R2/R3/R4)? | "my gut says 4, but 1 + 4 might have long term (and short term) benefits, debate" | Target: R1+R4 combo. Approach A (Lockfile) eliminated; debate is B (CA-AST) vs C (Merkle Tree). |
| 2 | C's bootstrap timing: bridges before registry, or wait? | "i got nothin" | "No gut" → defer to debate axis; not pre-debate gate. |
| 3 | C's source-canonical absoluteness: rule absolute, or bridges exception? | "i lean toward a vs b , but i think its worth having the debate with all three in the running" | Lean A vs B; keep C in for confirm-after-doubt. |
| 4 | G's Q1: unspoken use cases forcing AST-canonical? | "AI agents can figure it out. they will NOT be limiting factors of this language" | **Strategic realignment.** G's elimination of B was load-bearing on AI-agent friction; now invalidated. B back in G's debate. Source-canonical-as-pillar weakened to conditional. **Durable principle:** AI-agent friction is NOT a language-design constraint. |
| 5 | G's Q5: multi-version coexistence a need? | "both. and i think i like making it explicit" | **Q5=YES** + **superposition committed as explicit language pillar.** Triggered the 8th deep-dive. |

---

## 4. Strategic principles surfaced as durable directives

Captured in user-voice this session:

1. **Major moves require deep-dives + debates.** Methodology: radical doubt + know-everything mindsets. Every "major move" — language-level mechanism, compiler architecture, ecosystem-shape decision — runs the path: brain-dump → deep-dive → debate → design insight → spec/code. Skipping under time pressure is the path to drift.

2. **Radical doubt is a SAFETY mechanism**, not skepticism. *"radical doubt is mostly so I dont blindly back scrml into a dumb corner."* Defer-after-doubt (don't over-commit when reversible alternatives exist); confirm-after-doubt (a strong yes); reject-after-doubt requires explicit failure-mode evidence.

3. **Track 1 (preference) = conservative bias** vs **Track 2 (power) = extension bias**. The dumb corner is direction-dependent. For preference (UX, surface): dumb corner = over-engineering. For meta-system power: dumb corner = under-powering. Same principle, opposite directional bias.

4. **Real-time user-voice append**, not wrap-batched. Confirmed throughout S43 by appending after each disambiguation.

5. **"Make no mistakes" for irreversible operations** — full audit + multiple safety nets before destructive actions. Demonstrated in scrml-support staleness reconciliation: forensic survey + checksum verification + /tmp backups + reflog anchor before `git reset --hard`.

6. **Cross-machine sync hygiene** — added to scrmlTS pa.md (session-start fetch + ahead/behind check, session-end push verify, machine-switch protocol, recovery procedure for staleness discovered mid-session).

7. **AI-agent friction is NOT a language-design limiting factor.** Agents adapt. The LLM-mediated-adoption strategy is a go-to-market concern, NOT a language-design constraint. Conflating these costs design-time freedom for adoption-time anxieties.

8. **"Two things at the same time, until they collapse"** = superposition = explicit language pillar (committed S43). 18-month-old user intuition, originally mapped to async, now generalized.

9. **Voice-author agent first article queued:** *"Why programming for the browser needs a different kind of language."* Must NOT draft until bio is baked. Design-from-first-principles angle, NOT framework-fatigue. Never claim React/Vue/Svelte expertise the user doesn't have ("I can hobble through React if I HAVE TO" — canonical test case).

10. **Stalled background agents are recoverable IF progress files exist.** S43 demonstrated this: C's first stall (progress file → re-dispatch picked up); H's first stall (no progress file → seed kernel from agent's exit message); Superposition stall (scope + scaffolding survived → PA-write hybrid pattern). Hybrid PA-writes-load-bearing-then-agent-fills-rest worked on the 4th attempt where straight re-dispatches didn't.

---

## 5. Agent infrastructure built this session

### 5 foundational tech-experts forged (`~/.claude/agents/`)

| Agent | Lines | Color | Used in debates |
|---|---|---|---|
| nix-expert | 441 | blue | A, C, G |
| unison-expert | 344 | yellow | A, G, Superposition |
| bazel-expert | 410 | magenta | A, B, C, G |
| lean-lake-expert | 325 | cyan | A, G, possibly Superposition |
| security-expert | 432 | yellow | A, C, G, E |

### Custom scrml-ecosystem agent

| Agent | Lines | Color | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| scrml-voice-author | 298 | magenta | Bio curation + article drafting in user's voice (private to scrml-support) |

### Permission fix (settings.json)

Added to `/home/bryan-maclee/.claude/settings.json` `permissions.allow`:
- `Write(/home/bryan-maclee/.claude/agents/*)`
- `Edit(/home/bryan-maclee/.claude/agents/*)`
- `Read(/home/bryan-maclee/.claude/agent-registry.md)`
- `Read(/home/bryan-maclee/.claude/agents/*)`

This unblocked agent-forge — first 5 forges all hit Write-denied; permission fix in place mid-session enabled successful re-forges.

### Specialized experts STILL TO FORGE (next wave)

For B's debate: racket-#lang-expert, haskell-language-pragma-expert, rust-edition-expert, lean-tactic-mode-expert, bazel-toolchain-expert (or confirm bazel-expert covers).

For Superposition's debate (B vs E framing): modal-logic-expert, quantum-PL-expert, haskell-laziness-expert, erlang-hot-reload-expert.

For G's debate (A vs B vs C-hybrid): salsa-incremental-compilation-expert, simplicity-defender (for A's defense).

For C's debate: roc-expert, gingerbill-expert (security-expert + bazel-expert + unison-expert already forged).

---

## 6. Top of queue (S44 candidates)

### Immediate (clear, scoped)

1. **Decide on scrml-support push** — 18 untracked files including all 8 deep-dives + joint synthesis + user-voice-scrmlTS.md. Without push, S43 design work doesn't propagate cross-machine.
2. **Triage 6nz inbox bugs M/N/O** (parked at user direction).
3. **Move 2 stray progress files** from scrml-support root to `docs/deep-dives/`.
4. **Bake scrml-voice-author bio** — first invocation: bio crawl + bio file written. Then user reviews. Once bio is "fully baked," the first article *"Why programming for the browser needs a different kind of language"* unlocks.

### Investigation queue (per the strategic arc)

5. **Forge specialized experts (next wave)** — 8-10 agents covering B's debate + Superposition's debate + G's debate completers. Foundational set already done.
6. **Run debates** — 5 debates ready to fire after expert forging:
   - **A's debate** (R1+R4 combo target): B (CA-AST) vs C (Merkle Tree). Approach A (Lockfile) eliminated by user's R-reading choice.
   - **B's debate** (tier-ladder): file-pragma vs `<program>` attr vs lockfile. Block-tier deferred unless DSL-embed surfaces.
   - **C's debate** (bridges): A (Vendored) vs B (Living-Compiler Extensions) vs C (Distributed Hash Refs). Multi-axis (3 approaches × bootstrap-timing × source-canonical-absoluteness).
   - **E + combined A+B+E debate** (Path C from E): architecture-level meta-layer covering recoverability + config-swap + compiler.* + determinism.
   - **G's debate** (A vs B vs C-hybrid): file storage model with B favored under superposition lens.
   - **Superposition's own debate** (B vs E formalization): SPEC section vs SPEC + selective sigil/type-primitive.
7. **H's empirical prerequisite** — reactive-graph static-resolvability study. Could be a short focused investigation, not a full deep-dive.
8. **Codegen-rewrite UX deep-dive** — queued post-C (now landed) + post-E-Path-B (still pending). Practical UX question of "how does one rewrite codegen for something?"
9. **Spec-vs-implementation gap audit** — candidate based on F+E pattern. Survey where scrml promises more than the compiler delivers.
10. **Compile-time external-shape introspection deep-dive** — generalize SQL pattern to REST/GraphQL/gRPC/etc. Queued post-E.

### Compiler-bug carry (parked while design arc runs)

11. **Dispatch A7** — `${@reactive}` BLOCK_REF interpolation in component def. T2, intake `docs/changes/fix-component-def-block-ref-interpolation-in-body/intake.md`.
12. **Dispatch A8** — `<select><option>` children in component def. T2, intake at `docs/changes/fix-component-def-select-option-children/intake.md`. May resolve as side-effect of A7.
13. Settings.json PreToolUse hook for F4 — platform-level fix for agent tool-routing leak (S42 finding).
14. Stage 4/5/7/8 (Scope C) — README/PIPELINE/maps audit, validation re-run vs v1, cross-model validation, deeper warn-only sample classification.

### Carried from S41 + earlier

- Bug L re-attempt (widened scope; depends on string + regex + template + comment unification).
- Self-host parity (couples to Bug L).
- Auth-middleware CSRF mint-on-403 (session-based path) — partially shipped per S42 audit; remaining gap deferred.
- Phase 0 `^{}` audit continuation (4 items) — **CLOSED by E this session**, can be removed from queue.
- `scrml vendor add <url>` CLI — adoption gap; downstream of bridges debate (C).
- Bun.SQL Phase 2.5 — async PA + real Postgres introspection at compile time.
- LSP `endLine`/`endCol` Span detached.
- Strategic: Problem B (discoverability/SEO/naming).
- Cross-repo: 6nz playground-four cosmetic reverts.
- `dist/` pollution disposition (5 sessions running).

---

## 7. Open content backfill (tracked, not blocking)

`docs/changelog.md` backfill — S40, S41, S42 still missing (unchanged from S43 open). S43 entry being added at S43-close. Folding remaining sessions can happen as a focused content pass; not blocking compiler / design work.

---

## 8. Standing rules in force (S42 + S43)

### NEW in S43 (durable directives)

- Major moves require deep-dives + debates from radical-doubt + know-everything mindsets.
- Radical doubt is a safety mechanism, NOT skepticism. Direction-dependent bias per track.
- Real-time user-voice append (not wrap-batched).
- "Make no mistakes" for irreversible operations.
- Cross-machine sync hygiene (codified in pa.md).
- AI-agent friction is NOT a language-design constraint.
- Superposition is an explicit language pillar.
- scrmlTS docs/changelog.md is THE changelog (option-2 decision); pa.md "wrap" step 3 updated to point at it (NOT scrml-support/CHANGELOG-scrmlTS.md, which was retracted).
- scrml-voice-author maintains bio + drafts articles only from attested verbatim quotes.

### Carried from S42

- Hand-off context-density permanent rule.
- "wrap" is an 8-step operation (executed in this hand-off).
- Worktree-isolation startup verification + path discipline.
- `examples/VERIFIED.md` is user's verification log; PA never marks rows checked.

### Carried from S41 + earlier

- Every dev dispatch that writes scrml MUST include `docs/articles/llm-kickstarter-v1-2026-04-25.md` + `scrml-support/docs/gauntlets/BRIEFING-ANTI-PATTERNS.md`.
- Compiler-bug fixes via `scrml-dev-pipeline` with `isolation: "worktree"`, `model: "opus"`. PA does not edit compiler source directly without express user authorization.
- Commits to `main` only after explicit user authorization. Push only after explicit authorization. Authorization stands for the scope specified, not beyond.
- All agents on Opus (`model: "opus"`).

## 10. S43 commits (chronological)

```
82e5b0d docs(s43): cross-machine sync hygiene + staleness reconciliation arc
        (S43 mid-session: pa.md cross-machine sync hygiene + wrap step 3 changelog pointer + S43 hand-off staleness arc)
```

S43-close commit (after this hand-off lands) will add: hand-off comprehensive close + master-list update + changelog S43 entry.

Ran 7946 tests across 378 files. [12.55s]
```

UNCHANGED from S42 baseline (no compiler changes this session — design + agent infrastructure only).

---

## 12. Recommended next-session opening sequence

1. Read `pa.md` (standard).
2. Read this hand-off in full (it's bloated by design — that's the point).
3. Read `scrml-support/user-voice-scrmlTS.md` last 10+ contentful entries (S43 added many).
4. Decide on scrml-support push (§1 item 1) before any cross-machine work.
5. Triage 6nz inbox bugs M/N/O (§1 item 3) before substantive S44 work.
6. Surface §1 open questions to user.
7. Don't begin substantive work until §1 questions resolved.

If the next session is on the OTHER machine: per the new cross-machine sync hygiene rule, fetch + check ahead/behind on every repo before reading hand-off. If this machine has pushed scrml-support since S43 close, pull. If not, the other machine still doesn't have any of this session's design work — the master-PA inbox message at `~/scrmlMaster/handOffs/incoming/2026-04-26-1230-...` describes the situation.

---

## 13. Session log (chronological)

- 2026-04-26 — S43 opened. pa.md + S42-closed hand-off read. Rotated S42-closed → `handOffs/hand-off-43.md`. Verified scrmlTS clean + in sync with origin (HEAD `4db8d37`).
- 2026-04-26 — Surfaced two-changelogs problem (existing `docs/changelog.md` 803 lines, vs S42 PA's new `scrml-support/CHANGELOG-scrmlTS.md` 147 lines). User picked option 2: keep in-repo, retire scrml-support file. pa.md "wrap" step 3 updated.
- 2026-04-26 — User-voice strategy clarification (private + per-project + real-time append + voice-reference for articles).
- 2026-04-26 — Discovered scrml-support staleness (12 commits behind origin). Forensic audit + checksum verification + /tmp backups + reflog anchor. User stated "MAKE NO MISTAKES" principle.
- 2026-04-26 — Reset executed cleanly (`git reset --hard origin/main`). user-voice-scrmlTS.md keeper survived. CHANGELOG-scrmlTS.md retracted. user-voice-archive.md (2,837 lines) brought into local tree.
- 2026-04-26 — Added cross-machine sync hygiene section to scrmlTS pa.md. Dropped master-PA inbox message describing reconciliation arc.
- 2026-04-26 — Committed S43 cross-machine sync work to scrmlTS at `82e5b0d`; pushed to origin.
- 2026-04-26 — Living-compiler brain-dump waves: bridge registry (cm6), recoverability + comp-time-shape, `<compiler config>` mid-compile swap, distributed gingerBill-aligned, AI-agent friction not load-bearing.
- 2026-04-26 — User methodology directive: major moves require deep-dives + debates from radical-doubt + know-everything mindsets. "Keep pulling on every thread, dd and debat wherever the trail leads."
- 2026-04-26 — Compile-time external-shape introspection thread (LSP live-fetching from APIs). Captured + queued.
- 2026-04-26 — Meta-system "what CAN'T `^{}` do?" thread. Captured + queued as deep-dive E.
- 2026-04-26 — Canonical-IR + per-dev editor-alias brain-dump. Track 1 (preference) vs Track 2 (power) separation clarified.
- 2026-04-26 — User confirmed superposition committed as explicit language pillar (mid-Q5 disambiguation).
- 2026-04-26 — Dispatched 7 deep-dives in parallel: A, B, C, E, F, G, H. C and H stalled silently mid-session; re-dispatched both with strict-incremental-write enforcement; both eventually landed.
- 2026-04-26 — Dispatched 8th deep-dive (Superposition). Stalled at Phase 4. PA-write hybrid pattern: PA wrote §1 catalog + §5 formalization options + §8 coupling synthesis; focused fill-in agent landed remaining sections.
- 2026-04-26 — All 5 disambiguations answered (R1+R4 combo / bootstrap timing → debate axis / lean A vs B keep C / AI-friction not load-bearing / Q5 YES via superposition).
- 2026-04-26 — Joint A+B coupling synthesis written by PA (~150 lines, 4 coupling points + pre-debate anchor).
- 2026-04-26 — User authorized permission fix. update-config skill applied (Write/Edit/Read additions to ~/.claude/settings.json).
- 2026-04-26 — Forged 5 foundational tech-expert agents in 2 dispatch waves (5 hit permission block in wave 1; 2 re-dispatched and landed clean in wave 2 after permission fix; 3 had inline content saved by PA from wave 1 results).
- 2026-04-26 — Built scrml-voice-author custom agent for bio + article drafting. First article queued: *"Why programming for the browser needs a different kind of language"* (after bio bake).
- 2026-04-26 — User said "wrap." Executed 8-step wrap operation: hand-off, master-list, changelog, inbox surface, tests, working tree, push (scrmlTS yes; scrml-support held), meta-docs.
