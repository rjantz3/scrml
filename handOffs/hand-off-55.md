# scrmlTS — Session 53 (CLOSED — fat wrap, push complete, both repos)

**Date opened:** 2026-05-02 (machine-A, post-S52 close — same calendar day as S52)
**Date closed:** 2026-05-03 (session crossed midnight; long fixit-mode session)
**Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-54.md` (S52 close — fat wrap, +111 tests, both repos pushed; pre-saved during S52 wrap)
**Baseline entering S53:** scrmlTS at `eb0ec11` (S52 close, pushed); 8,491 pass / 40 skip / 0 fail / 412 files. scrml-support at `f016dad` then immediately `+1 commit` (P3 dive committed at S52 wrap).
**State at S53 close:** scrmlTS at `3a2e125` (44 commits past S52 close, **all pushed**); **8,576 pass / 40 skip / 0 fail / 426 files**. scrml-support pushed clean (S53 user-voice entry committed in this wrap). **Net delta from S52 close: +85 pass, +14 files, 0 regressions across 11 dispatches.**

## 0. The big shape of S53

**The "fixit go-go-go" session.** Triggered by user's S53-open verbatim "P3 recos good, go" (ratifying the P3 dive's full recommendation set). Continued with per-action greenlight cadence + the velocity directive ("this is fixit session. we go go go.") through 11 dispatches in a single session.

**Net session outcome:**
- **Engine rename arc COMPLETE** — keyword (P1, S52) + TAB type-decl synthesis (P3.B) + internal vars (P3-RENAME) + SPEC worked examples (P3-SPEC-PAPERWORK) + error codes (P3-ERROR-RENAME) + user-facing docs (DOC-E-RENAME) + AST shape (AST-SHAPE-RENAME). Only `ast.machineDecls` file-level container array name remains as small follow-up.
- **F-ENGINE-001 RESOLVED** via P3.B (TAB type-decl synthesis closes cross-file `<engine for=ImportedType>`).
- **F-CHANNEL-003 FULLY RESOLVED** via P3.A (architectural) + P3.A-FOLLOW (4 channels migrated, ~205 LOC reduction).
- **NR AUTHORITATIVE** post-P3-FOLLOW (25 routing reads migrated to `resolvedKind`/`resolvedCategory`; `state-type-routing.ts` disposed).
- **`scrml migrate` CLI shipped** (P4) — Migrations 1+2 (whitespace + machine keyword); Migration 3 deferred (Form 2 → Form 1 desugaring needs AST round-tripping).
- **W6 worktree discarded** at S53 open per OQ-P3-4 ratification.
- **+85 tests vs S52 close** (8491→8576), zero regressions across all 11 dispatches.
- **P3.B primary crashed mid-flight on ECONNRESET** at 41 min / 110 tool uses; T1-small continuation in existing worktree finished cleanly.

### Track A — W6 worktree discard

User authorization: `discard w6`. Branch `changes/w6` deleted (was at `b05812c`); worktree `agent-a566c25e34a40eb59` removed. P3 dive §3.1 preserves the W6 mechanism verbatim. Zero information loss.

### Track B — P3.B (T2-medium primary + T1-small continuation, +21 tests, merge `b794f64`)

T2-medium via scrml-dev-pipeline, worktree-isolated. **Primary crashed mid-flight** on API ECONNRESET after 41 min / 110 tool uses with 7 WIP commits (pre-snapshot + diagnosis + core TAB fix +90 LOC + 4 test tranches +804 LOC). 8,512 / 0 / 40 / 416 — architectural fix and tests landed and proven. Missing: SPEC + adopter + final summary commit.

**T1-small continuation** dispatched without `isolation: "worktree"`; operated in existing P3.B worktree (`agent-a1d083993abed7a25`) which was unlocked first. Brief gave explicit absolute-path WORKTREE_ROOT + path-discipline block. Continuation finished SPEC §51.3.2 message correction + §51.16 NEW (cross-file engine subsection) + §21.2 normative + PIPELINE Stage 3 amendment + adopter integration (`pages/driver/hos.scrml` workaround removed; imports `DriverStatus` from `../../schema.scrml`; ~6 LOC eliminated; FRICTION marks F-ENGINE-001 RESOLVED). 4 pre-existing F-NULL-001 errors on `null` literals in hos.scrml verified out-of-scope (compile pre-change baseline shows same errors). 11-commit FF-merge clean.

### Track C — P3.A (T2-large, +27 tests, merge `00c533a`)

T2-large via scrml-dev-pipeline, worktree-isolated. Channel cross-file inline-expansion via CHX (CE phase 2 under UCD). Closes F-CHANNEL-003 architecturally. ~700 LOC compiler refactor across:
- `compiler/src/types/ast.ts` (+45) — ChannelDeclNode + FileAST.channelDecls + ExportDeclNode.kind="channel"
- `compiler/src/ast-builder.js` (+200) — top-level `export <channel>` recognition + ChannelDeclNode synthesis + `_p3aIsExport` propagation + quoted-name import handling
- `compiler/src/module-resolver.js` (+30) — channel exports registered with `category` field
- `compiler/src/component-expander.ts` (+270) — UCD refactor: Phase 1 component + Phase 2 channel expansion + cross-file inline algorithm
- `compiler/src/state-type-routing.ts` NEW (+119) — transitional category routing table per OQ-P3-2 (b)
- `compiler/src/codegen/emit-channel.ts` (+15) — defensive `_p3aIsExport` filter
- `compiler/src/gauntlet-phase1-checks.js` (+12) — E-IMPORT-001 suppression extended to channel exports

~970 LOC tests across 8 new files. SPEC §21.2 + §38.12 NEW + §15.15.6 (~150 LOC). PIPELINE.md Stage 3.2 Phase 2 (~80 LOC). New error codes: E-CHANNEL-008 (cross-file `name=` collision) + E-CHANNEL-EXPORT-001 (channel exports without string-literal `name=`).

3 surprising findings: quoted import-name handling (`{ "dispatch-board" as alias }`) added inline as discrete fix; gauntlet Phase 1 fix (E-IMPORT-001 suppression mirroring P2 component pattern); P3 dive §6.2 worked-example has subtle scoping bug — agent used `examples/15-channel-chat.scrml` self-contained pattern instead.

### Track D — P3.A-FOLLOW (T1-small, +8 tests, merge `32a330b`)

Dispatch-app channel sweep. **4 channels of 4 migrated, none skipped:** dispatch-board (5 pages, ~60 LOC), customer-events (5 pages, ~70 LOC), load-events (3 pages, ~45 LOC), driver-events (2 pages, ~30 LOC). 4 PURE-CHANNEL-FILE exports created under `examples/23-trucking-dispatch/channels/`. 12 consumer pages updated. ~205 LOC inline boilerplate eliminated. FRICTION marks F-CHANNEL-003 → FULLY RESOLVED with migration table + LOC delta + zero-skip rationale.

### Track E — P3-FOLLOW (T2-medium, +4 tests, merge `ab589b3`)

Global migration of `isComponent` routing reads to NR-authoritative `resolvedKind` / `resolvedCategory`. **25 routing reads migrated.** `compiler/src/state-type-routing.ts` DELETED (transitional file disposed; zero in-tree consumers). SPEC §15.15.6 → "NameRes Authority (Post-P3-FOLLOW)". PIPELINE Stage 3.05 → AUTHORITATIVE. Files modified: component-expander.ts (added `isUserComponentMarkup` helper, 7 routing-read sites flipped) + module-resolver.js (vocabulary aligned: `category: "user-component"` from `"component"`) + name-resolver.ts (importedRegistry derivation prefers `info.category`; walker traverses `lift-expr.expr.node`) + type-system.ts (§35 attr validation gate flipped) + validators/post-ce-invariant.ts (VP-2 gate flipped to `resolvedKind` + uppercase-first-char heuristic) + types/ast.ts (deprecation note on `isComponent`; new fields declared) + lsp/handlers.js + lsp/workspace.js. New allowlist test `p3-follow-no-isComponent-routing.test.js` (4 tests).

5 surprising findings flagged: vocabulary divergence between NR/MR (now unified to `"user-component"`); NR walker lift-expr coverage gap closed; VP-2 semantic widening for unknown idents; NR-prefer-with-fallback pattern (preserves 105+ unit-test compatibility); dive's ~75-ref estimate vs actual ~25 read-site scope (with 78 remaining `isComponent` references being write-side stamps + intra-stage syntactic predicates + doc comments — bounded by allowlist test).

### Track F — P3-SPEC-PAPERWORK (T1-small, merge `7c0468e`)

SPEC.md worked-example sweep `<machine>` → `<engine>`. **19 replacements, 67 kept** (deprecation references, normative concept text, error-message templates, grammar rules, section headings, attribute-registry cross-reference list). Plan revision during execution: line 20623 (§52.13.3 closed-attribute-set list) reversed REPLACE→KEEP because it cross-references `compiler/src/attribute-registry.js`'s internal `"machine"` key. Migration plan documents per-occurrence rationale.

### Track G — P3-RENAME (T1-medium, merge `7a575c0`)

Internal compiler `machineName→engineName` identifier rename across 8 files. **58 internal renames, 11 references preserved** (1 AST field name `machineName` on AST node + 2 reads + 8 user-visible-text placeholders in JSDoc/error messages). Inventory delta vs dive's ~350 estimate: real read-site count is 68 in 9 files; renamed 58 of those. The AST field reads `node.machineName` deferred to AST-SHAPE-RENAME dispatch.

### Track H — P3-ERROR-RENAME (T1-small, merge `b302ede` post-rebase + 3-file conflict resolution)

Error code rename E-MACHINE-* → E-ENGINE-* across **20 codes / 367 occurrences across 34 files** (compiler/src 5 files + SPEC.md + tests 26 files + examples 2). Surprising finding: naive `s/E-MACHINE-/E-ENGINE-/g` is unsafe — `E-STATE-MACHINE-DIVERGENCE` contains `E-MACHINE-` as substring; agent adopted negative-lookbehind regex `(?<![A-Za-z0-9])E-MACHINE-`.

**PA-side conflict resolution at merge:** 3 files (`ast-builder.js`, `codegen/emit-machines.ts`, `type-system.ts`) had P3-RENAME's `engineName` and P3-ERROR-RENAME's `E-ENGINE-*` changing adjacent lines. Resolved by `git checkout --ours` (taking main's post-P3-RENAME state with `engineName` + old `E-MACHINE-*`) + Python re-application of `E-MACHINE-*` → `E-ENGINE-*` substitution (4 + 12 + 75 = 91 replacements). Combined result is union: `engineName + E-ENGINE-*`. Rebase completed, FF-merged.

### Track I — DOC-E-RENAME (T1-small, merge `7db7fd3`)

User-facing docs E-MACHINE-* refresh. **6 numeric-code renames across 3 files**: docs/tutorial.md (3), docs/articles/mutability-contracts-devto-2026-04-29.md (2), docs/tutorial-snippets/02l-derived-machine.scrml (1). compiler/SPEC-INDEX.md investigated + intentionally preserved — `E-MACHINE-DIVERGENCE` is typo'd shorthand for canonical `E-STATE-MACHINE-DIVERGENCE` (SPEC.md §51.15.4 lines 12881, 19883, 19918, 19925, 21815). Flagged as separate content-correction follow-up.

### Track J — P4 `scrml migrate` CLI (T1-small, +25 tests, merge `3deb87a`)

CLI command for automated rewrites of deprecated source patterns. **Migrations 1+2 shipped.** Migration 3 deferred.

- **Migration 1** (W-WHITESPACE-001): `< KEYWORD<boundary>` → `<KEYWORD<boundary>` for 14 known scrml lifecycle/structural keywords
- **Migration 2** (W-DEPRECATED-001): `<\s*machine` (opener) → `<\s*engine`, with trailing-boundary check to avoid `<machineState>` false-matches
- **Migration 3** (Form 2 → Form 1 component desugaring): **DEFERRED** — text-substitution can't safely handle the surrounding `${ }` block boundary; requires AST round-tripping. Tracked for P5+.

NEW: `compiler/src/commands/migrate.js` (~570 lines), `compiler/tests/unit/scrml-migrate.test.js` (25 tests across 12 sections). MODIFIED: `compiler/src/cli.js` (registered `migrate` subcommand + help text).

**Important finding:** `scrml migrate` name collision with SPEC §39.8 (reserved for SQL schema migration, spec'd but not yet shipped). Resolution options documented: mode flag (`--schema` vs `--syntax`), subcommand split (`scrml migrate-schema` vs `scrml migrate-syntax`), or auto-detect by argument type. The W-WHITESPACE-001 deprecation message in `name-resolver.ts:295` already points users to `scrml-migrate` (with hyphen), suggesting the spec author may have anticipated this. **Needs disposition decision before P5+.**

### Track K — AST-SHAPE-RENAME (T2-medium mechanical, merge `3a2e125`)

Final piece of the engine rename arc. AST `kind: "machine-decl"` → `"engine-decl"` literal + AST node field `machineName` → `engineName`. 25 files modified across compiler/src (3) + LSP (2) + tests (16) + docs (2) + artifacts (2). 0 regressions.

Surprising finding: pre-commit hook gates on full test pass, so source + tests had to land in single atomic commit (couldn't split into "TAB emits new shape" + "consumers migrated" + "tests migrated" as the brief suggested). Agent collapsed source + LSP + tests into one atomic commit (`bd48d14`); doc-only commits (`3966459`, `3a2e125`) cleanly separated.

`ast.machineDecls` (file-level container array) NOT renamed — out of dispatch scope. Documented as small follow-up cleanup.

## 3. Worktrees alive at close

11 dispatch worktrees from S53 (1 W6 + 10 dispatches) + many more from prior sessions. Cleanup is housekeeping — `git worktree prune` + per-worktree removal. Not blocking.

S53 worktrees:

### Status of major findings

| ID | S52 close | S53 close |
|---|---|---|
| F-AUTH-001 | UVB closed silent window | Same. Ergonomic completion (W7) deferred. |
| F-AUTH-002 | Layer 1 only; W5a + W5b deferred | Same. P3.A may interact with deferred W5-FOLLOW. |
| F-COMPONENT-001 | UVB + W2 architectural; F4 caveat | Same. F4 nested-PascalCase (F-COMPONENT-003 candidate) still open. |
| F-COMPONENT-003 | Open (carry-forward) | Open (S53 didn't address) |
| F-COMPONENT-004 | RESOLVED (S52) | RESOLVED |
| F-RI-001 | FULLY RESOLVED via W4 | Same. |
| F-CHANNEL-001 | UVB closed | Same. |
| **F-CHANNEL-003** | OPEN; W6 only Layer 1 (parked) | **FULLY RESOLVED** via P3.A + P3.A-FOLLOW (architectural mechanism + 4-channel adopter migration). |
| F-COMPILE-001 | E-CG-015 + dist tree preserved | Same. |

| **F-MACHINE-001 / F-ENGINE-001** | OPEN; W6 fix parked | **RESOLVED** via P3.B (TAB type-decl synthesis). |

### Newly-surfaced findings during S53 (small follow-ups)

| Finding | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **`scrml migrate` name collision with SPEC §39.8** | Open — needs disposition (mode flag / subcommand split / auto-detect) | P4 dispatch |
| **SPEC-INDEX.md `E-MACHINE-DIVERGENCE` typo** | Open — content correction follow-up | DOC-E-RENAME dispatch |
| **`ast.machineDecls` file-level container** | Open — small follow-up cleanup | AST-SHAPE-RENAME dispatch |
| **P4 Migration 3 (Form 2 → Form 1 desugaring)** | Deferred — needs AST round-tripping | P4 dispatch |

### Decisions made during S53 (load-bearing)

- **All 8 P3 OQs ratified** at user authorization "P3 recos good, go": UCD over SP; separate P3.A/B dispatches with P3.B first; per-category NR routing for P3.A/B + P3-FOLLOW for the 75-ref migration; W6 discard; PURE-CHANNEL-FILE auto-recognized; E-CHANNEL-008 hard error on cross-file `name=` collision; `channels/` at app-root convention; SQL-via-page-ancestor pattern documented (W5-FOLLOW continues independently).
- **`scrml migrate` shipped under that name despite SPEC §39.8 collision** — surfaced as open finding, not preventive.
- **AST-SHAPE-RENAME** completes the engine arc (except the small `ast.machineDecls` follow-up).

---

## 6. ⚠️ Things the next PA needs to NOT screw up

1. **`scrml migrate` collides with SPEC §39.8 (SQL schema migration).** The spec text reserves `scrml migrate` for SQL schema migration (which hasn't shipped). The current implementation also uses that name. Before SQL schema migration ships, the user must decide: mode flag (`--schema` vs `--syntax`), subcommand split (`scrml migrate-schema` vs `scrml migrate-syntax`), or auto-detect by argument type. **Surface this at S54 open if it's not already done.**

2. **`ast.machineDecls` file-level container array name** still uses old-name. AST-SHAPE-RENAME's scope was the AST node `kind` literal + per-node field; the file-level container is technically different. Small follow-up cleanup; uniformity at the file-level would polish the engine arc.

3. **SPEC-INDEX.md `E-MACHINE-DIVERGENCE` typo** — should be canonical `E-STATE-MACHINE-DIVERGENCE`. Content correction; preserved per DOC-E-RENAME's brief but flagged for follow-up.

4. **P4 Migration 3 deferred.** Form 2 → Form 1 component desugaring requires AST round-tripping (round-trip from AST back to scrml source). Not P4-scope (text substitution). Tracked for P5+.

5. **Pre-existing F-NULL-001 errors in `pages/driver/hos.scrml`** persist (P3.B continuation verified pre-change baseline shows same 4 errors; out-of-scope). NOT a regression.

6. **Pre-existing samples emit 60 W-WHITESPACE-001 warnings** — `samples/compilation-tests/` use `< db>` style intentionally (testing the deprecation). NOT a bug.

7. **Wart in api.js stage label rename** (S52 P1.E) still in place — P1.E renamed gauntlet check stage labels (3.05/3.06 → 3.005/3.006) to avoid clash with NR's Stage 3.05. Cosmetic.

8. **Authorization scope discipline.** S53's pattern: "P3 recos good, go" + "discard w6" + "auth. then next" + "1 2" + "this is fixit session. we go go go." + "continue" + "wrap" + "go". Per-action greenlights with explicit velocity directive. **DOES NOT carry into S54.** Re-confirm before any merge / push / cross-repo write / dispatch.

9. **`--no-verify` policy STILL OPEN.** S53 had ZERO violations across 11 dispatches. The question of formalizing TDD red commits / `WIP:` prefix exemption remains unresolved. (Long-standing carry-forward.)

10. **Worktree cleanup deferred** — at least 11 S53 worktrees alive at close (1 discarded W6 + 10 merged). Plus dozens from prior sessions. `git worktree prune` + per-worktree removal as housekeeping.

11. **Master inbox stale messages STILL OPEN** (S26 giti, S43 reconciliation, S49 + S51 + S52 push notices). S53 push-complete notice will be filed at this wrap. Master's queue.

12. **Tutorial Pass 3-5 + 5 unpublished article drafts STILL pending** — multi-session carry-forward.

### Suggested S54 first move candidates

- **Mechanical paperwork** — `ast.machineDecls` rename + `scrml migrate` collision disposition + SPEC-INDEX.md typo. Cheap deck-clearing; complete the engine arc polish.
- **F-COMPONENT-003** — nested-PascalCase Phase-1 limitation. Pre-S52 carry-forward; may be a 5-LOC fix or a small architectural one (depends on diagnosis).
- **F-PARSER-ASI sweep** — 30 trailing-content warnings. Batch fix that reduces noise across samples.
- **W5a / W5b** — cross-file SQL `?{}` resolution. Coordinated with P3.A's deferred SQL-via-page-ancestor pattern.

## 8. needs:push state at S53 close

scrmlTS commits on `main`: **all pushed to origin clean.** All 44 commits past S52 close shipped. Final state HEAD `3a2e125` plus the wrap commit landing now.

scrml-support: pushed clean prior to this wrap. The wrap commit (S53 user-voice append) is in this wrap; will require another push.

**S53 close: PUSH AUTHORIZED via "wrap" + "go"** per pa.md "wrap" definition step 7.

## 11. User direction summary (the through-line)

Verbatim user statements (S53). All appended to `scrml-support/user-voice-scrmlTS.md` per pa.md.

### Session start
> read pa. md and start sess

### P3 ratification + first dispatch (multi-question terse)
> P3 recos good, go

### W6 discard authorization
> discard w6

### Per-merge cadence
> auth. then next   (P3.B merge + push + dispatch P3.A)
> 1                  (P3.A as next dispatch)
> auth to merge, then lets go on as much as we can   (P3.A merge + go on parallel dispatches)

### THE VELOCITY DIRECTIVE
> this is fixit session. we go go go.

### Background dispatch + bookkeeping authorization
> keep going on what ever you have answers for or seems obvious

### Continue dispatches
> 1 2     (P4 + DOC-E-RENAME parallel)
> continue (AST-SHAPE-RENAME)

### Wrap directive
> wrap
> go

### Through-line for S53

User mode through the session:
- **Per-action greenlights, full forward motion + explicit velocity directive.** "fixit session. we go go go." removed friction from per-action confirmation while still requiring per-action authorization.
- **Architecturally pre-ratified scope.** "P3 recos good, go" set the surface area; subsequent dispatches stayed within ratified P3 dive recommendations.
- **PA flagged unexpected findings rather than auto-resolving.** P3-RENAME's `ast.machineDecls` deferral, P4's `scrml migrate` SPEC §39.8 collision, AST-SHAPE-RENAME's atomic source+tests commit pattern were surfaced for user awareness.
- **Crash recovery without intervention.** P3.B primary ECONNRESET → T1-small continuation worked cleanly via PA-side recovery dispatch.
- **Production-grade language goal preserved.** Every fix landed with: pre-snapshot + diagnosis + minimal fix + green tests + spec amendment + FRICTION update + final summary commit. Zero regressions across 11 dispatch waves.
- **Bookkeeping interleaved with dispatches** ("keep going on what ever you have answers for") — PA used this to keep hand-off + master-list + changelog current as merges landed.

### Authorization scope (closing note)

S53's per-action authorization pattern was scoped throughout. **It does NOT carry into S54.** Per pa.md "Authorization stands for the scope specified, not beyond." Re-confirm before any merge / push / cross-repo write / dispatch.

---

## 12. Permanent operational findings from S53 (reference for future PA)

### F1 — Crash recovery via T1-small continuation in existing worktree

P3.B primary crashed at 41 min / 110 tool uses on ECONNRESET. T1-small continuation dispatched WITHOUT `isolation: "worktree"` (operates in existing P3.B worktree at `agent-a1d083993abed7a25`; brief gave explicit absolute-path WORKTREE_ROOT + path-discipline block). Continuation finished SPEC + adopter + final commit cleanly.

**Pattern:** when a primary agent crashes mid-flight with substantial committed progress, the recovery dispatch is T1-small + operates in the existing worktree (not a fresh one) + scope-limited to "finish what's missing." The existing worktree must be unlocked first via `git worktree unlock <path>`.

### F2 — Parallel dispatches with file-domain disjointness + rebase chain on merge

S53 dispatched 3-5 dispatches in parallel multiple times. They branched from the same main HEAD; each FF-merged the first; subsequent merges required `git rebase` of their branch onto the new main HEAD. When file domains are disjoint (e.g., compiler/src vs SPEC.md vs examples/), rebase is conflict-free and FF-merge succeeds. When file domains overlap (e.g., P3-RENAME + P3-ERROR-RENAME both touched compiler/src/type-system.ts), conflict resolution is required.

**Pattern:** after first FF-merge in a parallel batch, rebase remaining branches onto new main via `git -C <worktree-path> rebase main`. If conflicts arise on overlapping changes that should compose (P3-RENAME's `engineName` + P3-ERROR-RENAME's `E-ENGINE-*` are independent edits to nearby lines), resolve by `git checkout --ours <file>` (take main's version) + Python re-application of the second branch's substitution.

### F3 — Pre-commit hook gates atomic source+tests commits

The pre-commit hook runs `bun test compiler/tests/unit compiler/tests/integration compiler/tests/conformance --bail`. This means a "TAB emits new shape" commit followed by "consumers migrated" commit followed by "tests migrated" commit is INFEASIBLE — the source-only commit fails the hook because tests fail. AST-SHAPE-RENAME agent bundled source + LSP + tests into one atomic commit (`bd48d14`); doc-only commits separated.

**Pattern:** brief should specify "atomic source+tests commit OK" for refactors that change observable AST shape. Doc-only and SPEC-only commits can stay separated.

### F4 — PA cwd switching during background-agent task notifications

When a background agent's worktree completion notification arrives, the harness may route subsequent bash commands' cwd into that worktree (per S53 "I'm in the P3-SPEC-PAPERWORK worktree" recovery moment). PA must `cd /home/bryan-maclee/scrmlMaster/scrmlTS &&` explicitly at the start of merge-related commands to ensure operating from main.

**Pattern:** the first thing PA's bash command should do post-task-notification is `cd /home/bryan-maclee/scrmlMaster/scrmlTS && pwd` to confirm cwd. Branch operations (FF-merge, push) MUST run from main repo path, not from a worktree path.

### F5 — Worktree dependency provisioning (bun install + compile-test-samples.sh)

Multiple S53 dispatches reported that fresh worktrees lacked `compiler/node_modules` and `samples/compilation-tests/dist/` artifacts. Pre-test runs would show ~134 environmental failures until provisioning. Once provisioned, baseline matches.

**Pattern:** PA dispatch briefs should include "if `bun test` shows ~130 environmental failures, run `cd compiler && bun install && cd .. && bash scripts/compile-test-samples.sh`." This is worktree-cold-start friction, not a regression.
