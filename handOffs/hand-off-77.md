**Date opened:** 2026-05-10
**Date closed:** 2026-05-10 (single-day session, ~heavy throughput)
**Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-76.md` (S76 close — body-split min-viable v0.2.0 SHIPPED · A8 family CLOSED · C15 follow-up family CLOSED · 2 Insight-28 OQs RESOLVED · 4 SHIPs + 8 chore/record · +116 tests · 0 regressions)
**This file:** rotates to `handOffs/hand-off-77.md` at S78 open
**Tests at open (S76 close baseline):** 10,879 pass / 60 skip / 1 todo / 0 fail (508 files)
**Tests at S77 close:** **10,961 pass / 64 skip / 1 todo / 6 fail** (513 files; 6 fails ALL environmental on this machine — 3 self-host artifacts not built; 3 test-bind A6-5 with hard-coded `/home/bryan-maclee/` cwd. Net delta from open baseline: **+82 pass**.)

## S77 open — caught up

**Cross-machine sync (session-start protocol):** scrmlTS 0/0 origin (clean). scrml-support 0/0 origin (5 untracked voice/articles drafts + tools/ — voice-author work, no conflict). Both repos clean working tree.

**S76 wrap state inherited:** large 4-SHIP session combining one major background-agent dispatch (A9 Ext 5 ~50h budget) with parallel PA-direct closures of two long-standing follow-up families. Six items from S75's "open questions" menu were closed in S76: A9 Ext 5 (body-split min-viable v0.2.0 — closes A9 family entirely with Ext 4 from S72), §C15.11/§C15.12, §C15.13 (closes C15 follow-up family), A8 A6-5 (closes A8 family A6-1+A6-2+A6-3+A6-4+A6-5), Insight-28 OQ-bridge-3, OQ-bridge-4 (Insight-28 standing OQs reduced 5→1; only bridge-5 remains).

**Inbox state:** scrmlTS `handOffs/incoming/` empty (only `read/` archive). No pending action items.

**Master inbox carry-overs (3 legacy/superseded — safe-to-ignore unless sweep requested):**
- `2026-04-22-scrmlTS-to-master-insight-25-multi-meta.md` (UNREAD legacy, S30s era)
- `2026-05-08-S72-scrmlTS-to-master-needs-push-SUPERSEDED.md` (renamed at master-push retirement)
- `2026-05-08-S71-scrmlTS-to-master-stage-scrml-dev-pipeline.md` (UNREAD; pipeline-substitution clean across 30+ dispatches in S73-S76)

**User-voice state:** last contentful session entries are at S72 (2026-05-08). S73-S76 produced no new user-voice entries; this is consistent with those sessions being primarily implementation/SHIP work without new durable user statements. The S77 PA should append normally if any durable user statements arise.

**Worktree branches retained:** 10 (9 from S75 + 1 new from S76). Forensic per S67; not cleanup priority.

---

## Next priority — menu (substantial S76-residual items)

Carrying the S76-close menu forward (S77 selection awaits user direction):

1. **A5 family follow-on (S67-ratified engine extensions, deferred A5-5/A5-6/A5-7):**
   - A5-5 computed-delay impl (~1.5-2.5h smallest)
   - A5-6 Item G B-shakeable timer extensions (~5-10h optional)
   - A5-7 tests + samples (~12-18h)

2. **A9 Ext 5 follow-ups (3 in-scope-but-thin, deferred from S76 dispatch):**
   - D1 export-synth modifier propagation — `export function foo().idempotent()` synthesized shadow node doesn't carry `idempotentModifier` flag through; modifier text preserved in raw export emission so no production breakage today; surface if friction.
   - D3 pure-fn-call detection in classifier — over-emits keys (sound but wasteful); needs threading `functionIndex` through analyzer.
   - D5 Redis backend inlining — stubbed in `runtime/idempotency.js`; SQL backend covers default-resolution; add when adopter explicitly uses `idempotency-store="redis"`.

3. **A6-6 optional API alignment** — LSP/CG API design dive (TBD).

4. **Codegen tightening — consecutive-let in `~{}` body** (filed S76 via A6-5 integration testing). `~{}` test-block body codegen joins tokens with single spaces but doesn't insert separators between consecutive `let` statements (`let a = f(); let b = g();` emits as one line, fails to parse as JS). Same root cause as test-bind RHS string-quote-strip artifact (raw token-join in test-block body codegen). Documented inline in `compiler/tests/integration/test-bind-end-to-end.test.js` docblock. ~30min-1h fast fix once located in `emit-test.ts` token-joiner.

5. **Insight 28 OQ-bridge-5** — compile-time WARNING when bridged validator on schema-column field — defer to compiler-diagnostics audit pass (per S76 hand-off).

6. **Insight 28 OQ-bridge-2** — passive (re-debate trigger on ≥3 adopter friction reports).

**Articles thread (5 in-flight drafts at scrml-support/voice/articles/):** Per pa.md Rule 1, no PA-volunteered marketing work; await user-raised threads.

## Background dispatches (both LANDED)

**A5-4 + A5-5 bundled** — LANDED at `7b5744d` (no push — user authorized "Commit, no push" pending review).
- Worktree branch retained for forensic per S67: `worktree-agent-a07c10f3c25603c26` at `a6cfb30` (7 incremental commits)
- 18 files / +2480 LOC / 73 new tests / 0 SCOPE-§3 deviations

**Memory-leak deep-dive refresh** — LANDED on scrml-support at `1f71ef3` (no push — user authorized "Commit, no push").
- New dated successor: `docs/deep-dives/memory-leak-detection-2026-05-10.md`
- Original frontmatter flipped `status: active` → `superseded`, pointer added
- Headline: 1 NEW leak surface (W-LEAK-010 idempotency unbounded growth); 2 categories shifted to structural prevention (timers via `<timer>`, WS via `<channel>`); LC pass slot moved Stage 7.5 → Stage 7.6 (BP took 7.5)

---

## Open questions to surface immediately at S78 open

1. **Push state — both repos have unpushed commits.** scrmlTS at `7b5744d` (3 commits ahead — codegen-tightening + SCOPE doc + A5-4+5 SHIP). scrml-support at `1f71ef3` (1 commit ahead — deep-dive refresh). User authorized "Commit, no push" on both; push is at PA's discretion at wrap or on user request.

2. **A5-4 + A5-5 SHIP open questions (Q1-Q4 from agent report):**
   - **Q1 (defer):** SPEC editorial pass clarifying chained-rearm-skips-computed semantics. Spec is silent on what happens with computed delays in chains; small one-line addition could clarify. Defer as a SPEC editorial pass.
   - **Q2 (file as A5-5b):** Follow-on dispatch for legacy `<machine>` body-parser fix to preserve `${...}` text. ~1-2h chore-tier estimated. The legacy `<machine>` computed-delay codegen surface IS in place; only the BS body-parser missing. Engine `<onTimeout>` form (S67-recommended) works end-to-end without this fix.
   - **Q3 (out-of-scope, optional):** C13 tree-shake test robustness — agent scrubbed comments mentioning `_scrml_engine_direct_set` from the 'machine' chunk so the existing C13 tree-shake test continues to pass. Could regex-anchor the assertion to function declarations rather than free-text mentions. Out of A5-4/A5-5 scope.
   - **Q4 (PA-confirmed correct):** Initial-arm timing deviation from SCOPE Phase 1e — agent split `emitEngineInitialArmsForFile` into a separate helper called AFTER `emitReactiveWiring` because integration testing surfaced an ordering bug (computed-form `${@var}<unit>` would read undefined at module-init under original design). Bug-driven correction, not scope-creep — PA confirms the deviation is principled.

3. **Memory-leak deep-dive next steps (per refresh §7.2):**
   - Step 1 (lowest-cost-fastest): W-LEAK-010 SPEC §34 catalog row + cross-ref from §19.9.6 (docs-only PR; surfaces eviction gap to spec readers)
   - Step 2: `<program idempotency-store=>` background sweeper (CG/runtime dispatch) — structural fix that eliminates W-LEAK-010
   - Step 3: LC pass implementation (Stage 7.6, SCOPE-AND-DECOMPOSITION dispatch)
   - Recommendation: hold for v0.3.0+ unless W-LEAK-010 spec-amendment is fast-tracked

## Things S78 PA must NOT screw up (S70-S76 cumulative)

S76-close standing list (items 113-211) carries forward verbatim. **S77 NEW additions:**

212. **A5-4 + A5-5 SHIPPED at `7b5744d` (S77).** Engine `<onTimeout>` codegen + computed-delay relaxation across both temporal surfaces. 18 files / +2480 LOC / 73 new tests / 0 regressions. Legacy `<machine>` body-parser `${...}` preservation is the deferred follow-on (filed as Q2 A5-5b chore-tier ~1-2h); engine `<onTimeout>` works end-to-end. Computed-form rules opt out of JSON-encoded chained re-arm (single-step works, multi-step computed→computed chains require user-driven writes — documented inline + tests). Worktree branch retained: `worktree-agent-a07c10f3c25603c26` at `a6cfb30`.

213. **Codegen-tightening fix (consecutive-`let` in `~{}` body) shipped S77 at `8379b92`.** Test-body collector now splits on depth-0 `;` PUNCT and on depth-0 statement-keyword tokens beginning on a new source line. Both KEYWORD and IDENT token kinds accepted. Brace depth fully respected. Closes S76 A6-5 follow-up. +11 unit tests.

214. **Memory-leak deep-dive refreshed S77 at scrml-support `1f71ef3`.** New dated successor `memory-leak-detection-2026-05-10.md`; original frontmatter flipped to superseded. **One NEW leak surface confirmed:** A9 Ext 5 idempotency-key shadow tables grow unbounded (24h TTL but **lazy-eviction-only**; documented inline at `compiler/runtime/idempotency.js:74-77`). **W-LEAK-010 recommended (info-level).** Two leak categories shifted to structural prevention (timers via `<timer>`, WS via `<channel>`). LC pass placement moves Stage 7.5 → Stage 7.6 (BP took 7.5). 8 other NEW post-2026-03-28 surfaces audited and verified clean. Recommendation: hold for v0.3.0+ unless W-LEAK-010 spec-amendment is fast-tracked.

215. **6 environmental fails on this machine carried forward.** 3 self-host artifacts not built (Bootstrap L3 timeout; tokenizer parity needs `compiler/self-host/dist/tab.js` which doesn't exist on this machine); 3 test-bind A6-5 integration tests with hard-coded `/home/bryan-maclee/` cwd (works on the other machine where username matches; fails here where username is `bryan`). Pre-existing, NOT caused by S77 work.

216. **String-token quote-preservation across all test-block parsers shipped S77 at `6075a81`.** New `tokenToSourceText(tok)` helper in `parseTestBody` re-wraps STRING tokens (JSON.stringify for plain, backticks for `isTemplate`) before joining tokens back into source-text expressions. Applied to all 4 collectors (collectBody, collectAssertTokens, parseTestBindDecl RHS, non-assert test body). Same root-cause family as the consecutive-`let` fix. +5 unit tests covering RHS / asserts / body / before-block / backtick template.

217. **A5-5b SHIPPED S77 at `b22c6d3`** — legacy `<machine>` body-parser `${...}` preservation. Phase 0 finding revised the SCOPE doc's hypothesis: BS preserves `${...}` correctly in logic-child `.raw`; the bug was a spurious `\n` in ast-builder.js's `rulesRaw` concat (line 9086) fragmenting multi-child rules. **One-line fix.** Both temporal surfaces (engine `<onTimeout>` + legacy `<machine>` arrow rules) now end-to-end with bit-identical runtime semantics. **A5 computed-delay family fully CLOSED.** Computed-form rules opt out of JSON-encoded chained auto-rearm per §51.12.4 S77 amendment. +3 unit tests in computed-delay.test.js §A5-5.5b.
